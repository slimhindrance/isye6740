It provides a set of new coordinates. PCA is reversible, i.e., the PC scores can be mapped back to the original feature space (original coordinates). (except for the loss due to the truncation of selecting only a portion of eigenvectors)</paragraph><paragraph>The general reconstruction procedure is as follows:</paragraph><paragraph>1. the input data has dimension 784x1, $x_i \\in \\mathbb R^{784 \\times 1}$</paragraph><paragraph>2. with PCA, you have reduced dimension 4x1</paragraph><paragraph>3. you use the 4x1 data to train GMM. The GMM model parameters have the dimension of 4, i.e., $\\mu_k \\in \\mathbb R^4, \\Sigma_k \\in \\mathbb R^{4 \\times 4}$. $k = 1, 2$ is the index of the GMM component.</paragraph><paragraph>4. to visualize the model mean vector and covariance matrix, you need to reconstruct them back to 784x1</paragraph><paragraph><break/></paragraph><paragraph>let $\\mu_k$ be the model mean vector, $\\Sigma$ be the covariance matrix learned from EM, $\\mu$ has dimension 4-by-1, $\\Sigma$ has dimension 4-by-4.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>The reconstructed the model mean vector is given by,</bold></paragraph><paragraph>$$\\tilde{\\mu_k} = U_4 \\Lambda^{1/2}_4  \\mu_k + \\gamma$$</paragraph><paragraph>where $\\gamma = \\frac1m \\sum_i x_i$ is the mean of data set.</paragraph><paragraph>$\\mu_k \\in \\mathbb R^{4\\times 1}$ is the model mean of the $k$th GMM component, </paragraph><paragraph><bold>The reconstructed model covariance matrix is given by</bold></paragraph><paragraph>$$\\tilde \\Sigma = U_k \\Lambda^{1/2} \\Sigma \\Lambda^{1/2} U_k^T$$</paragraph><paragraph>where $U_4$ is the 784x4 matrix you got from PCA, each column is one eigenvector</paragraph><paragraph>$\\Lambda_4$ is the 4x4 diagonal matrix, the diagonal entries are the corresponding eigenvalues from PCA</paragraph><paragraph>for simplicity, you do not need to add the data mean vector back for the visualization.</paragraph><paragraph>ps: reconstruction for the covariance matrix is not required for hw3</paragraph><paragraph>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</paragraph><paragraph>Below are some derivation details, which are mostly the basic linear algebras about PCA</paragraph><paragraph>The idea is as follows, </paragraph><paragraph>1. given a data set $X = \\{x_i\\}^m_{i=1}, x_i \\in \\mathbb R^d$. the data mean $\\gamma = \\frac1m x_i$ and the covariance matrix</paragraph><paragraph>$$C =\\frac1m\\sum_i (x_i-\\gamma)(x_i-\\gamma)^T$$</paragraph><paragraph>with PCA</paragraph><paragraph>$$C = \\sum_{j=1}^d \\lambda_j u_j u_j^T$$</paragraph><paragraph>(to avoid confusion, we use $\\gamma$ to denote the data mean)</paragraph><paragraph>2. perform dimensionality reduction to the data set, and you get a new data set $\\hat X = \\{\\hat x_i\\}^m_{i=1}$, where</paragraph><paragraph>$$\\hat x_i = \\Lambda_K^{-1/2} U_K^T (x_i-\\gamma) \\quad \\quad (\\ast)$$</paragraph><paragraph>where $U_K = [u_1, u_2, \\cdots, u_K]$ is the truncated eigenmatrix with $K$ selected eigenvectors as columns, it has the dimension d-by-K. (In this hw problem setting, $K=4$)</paragraph><paragraph>$\\Lambda_k = \\text{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\cdots, \\lambda_K)$ is the truncated eigenvalues matrix, which $K$ corresponding eigenvalues on the diagonal entries.</paragraph><paragraph>(note, any vector in the original data space can follow the equation $\\ast$ to be transformed into the reduced dimensional space.)</paragraph><paragraph>Keep in mind, your GMM algorithm works on the reduced-dimension data set $\\hat X$</paragraph><paragraph><break/></paragraph><paragraph>3. from the GMM, you get your mixture component mean vectors, denoted as $\\hat \\mu \\in \\mathbb R^K$, in our case, K=4.

For what I understood from the lecture, the covariance matrix is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{m}X X^T$, where $X = [x^1 - \\mu, ..., x^m - \\mu]$, and by applying the SVD on it we conclude that the eigenvectors of $C$ will be the left singular vectors of $X$ and the eigenvalues will be the squared singular values obtained by the decomposition. With that, we have enough information to perform PCA.\n\nHowever, in the slide 28 (lecture 4) we have:\n\n"Eigenvectors of 𝐶 corresponds to left singular vectors of 𝑋\nFind the weight vectors {𝑤 ! , 𝑤 " , ⋯ , 𝑤 1 } as the 𝑟 left singular vectors\nof the data matrix 𝑋 (𝑟 is the number of principle components)"\n\nWith that in mind, I\'m confused.

Which is why the tests generate a html snippet which can directly be used to view the generated compressed image for Q3.\n\nGradescope output should ideally match the images provided on the report. Thus we know the images are truly your own output. We can focus on the correctness of the solution vs the authenticity of the same. \n\nThe steps below with example snippet outline how the gradescope output can be used to verify what we will see as

Let\'s say for a certain image (e.g., "sea turtle") we run K-means using L2 norm distance function with k=48 and we get 3 empty clusters. Do we then set k=45 and try running again until we have absolutely no empty clusters? What will Gradescope do then if it gets a "class" output variable that has less than k=48 distinct values in it?

Please use this post as a guide as you begin to work through our homework assignments.<break/><break/><bold>Submission Guidelines:</bold><break/><break/>As the syllabus highlights, we will expect you to provide two different files within a homework submission on Canvas.<break/><break/>1. A pdf file, with the following naming convention: \'GTUsername_HWx_report.pdf\'. This pdf should represent the a summary of the work you did on the assignment, including derivations, useful plots, and written explanation/analysis where prompted by the assignment. This must be provided as a separate file...Canvas gives your graders a lot of useful tools for pdfs which make it much easier for us to grade you. When everyone does this, we can provide you more feedback, in a more timely manner.<break/>2. A zip file with the name \'GTUsername_HWx.zip\'. This zip file must have all of your code and the data it requires to run. In other words, a TA should be able to run your code as is from the zip file and reproduce your results, without any modification required.<break/><break/><bold>If there are any issues with the submission format above for any assignment, you will lose 11 points. As the syllabus says, please stick to the requested format to avoid unnecessary loss of points. You might think this is unfair, but it\'s very important for us; students who don\'t follow this policy make it harder for the TAs to finish grading on time.</bold></paragraph><paragraph><bold>Your homework report must contain all plots, images, analysis, and question answers in the PDF report. Anything present in code/files in your zip but not in your report will not receive points.<break/></bold><break/>For the pdf, you are free to use any markdown tool you like. That said, as the syllabus notes...we don\'t want you to just provide code!

Please use this post as a guide as you begin to work through our homework assignments.\n\nSubmission Guidelines:\n\nAs the syllabus highlights, we will expect you to provide two different files within a homework submission on Canvas.\n\n1. A pdf file, with the following naming convention: 'GTUsername_HWx_report.pdf'. This pdf should represent the a summary of the work you did on the assignment, including derivations, useful plots, and written explanation/analysis where prompted by the assignment. This must be provided as a separate file...Canvas gives your graders a lot of useful tools for pdfs which make it much easier for us to grade you. When everyone does this, we can provide you more feedback, in a more timely manner.\n2. A zip file with the name 'GTUsername_HWx.zip'. This zip file must have all of your code and the data it requires to run. In other words, a TA should be able to run your code as is from the zip file and reproduce your results, without any modification required.\n\nIf there are any issues with the submission format above for any assignment, you will lose 11 points. As the syllabus says, please stick to the requested format to avoid unnecessary loss of points. You might think this is unfair, but it's very important for us; students who don't follow this policy make it harder for the TAs to finish grading on time.\n\nYour homework report must contain all plots, images, analysis, and question answers in the PDF report. Anything present in code/files in your zip but not in your report will not receive points.\n\nFor the pdf, you are free to use any markdown tool you like. That said, as the syllabus notes...we don't want you to just provide code!

This can only be accomplished if $\\mu\\mu^T$ is a elementwise scalar multiple of C.
