<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hi,</paragraph><paragraph>I am stuck on the first part of question 2, performing PCA where the food types are the features and each country represents a data point. </paragraph><paragraph>In this case, the number of data points are m = 16, and there are n = 20 features. My C matrix is mxm, 16x16, and after finding the first 2 eigen vectors, w, I see that the w matrix is 16x2. If I use this to find the first 2 principal components, z, I'm left with a 20x2 matrix. The dimensions of this z matrix don't make sense to me. Shouldn't it be mx2, instead of nx2? In my mind, z contains the coordinates of the transformed data points in the new principal directions. So, it should be mxk, where k is the number of principal directions I choose. </paragraph><paragraph>The added the plot to give so you could see if the end result looks correct or not. I followed the demo code to plot the data, and even though 'dim1' and 'dim2' (my z vectors) have a length of 20, I only plotted the first 16 values because there are 16 data points/countries.</paragraph><figure><image src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/F5xaDahJigd4chwKEBmr1jdY" width="424" height="278"/></figure><paragraph/></document>

Answer from User 962232:
I'm not quite sure how you are ending up with a 20x2 matrix. You should be left with eigenvectors of length 16x1 for each eigenvector (a row for each data point) and take the two most significant eigenvectors to end up with a 16x2 matrix that you would then use for your plot. It looks to me that you are calculating the eigenvectors on the wrong dimension of your matrix that you are trying to analyze.
