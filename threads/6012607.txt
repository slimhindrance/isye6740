<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hi,</paragraph><paragraph>I was wondering if there was any partial grading for question 3 on homework 1. My vectorized code is not running smoothly and the kernel keeps dying at k=48. Should I focus on fixing this but the code potentially doesn't work for k=24/48 OR should i focus on having output for all k values, even though my code does not satisfy the runtime requirement. Having a hard time prioritizing while i debug, please let me know! </paragraph><paragraph/><paragraph>Thanks</paragraph><paragraph/></document>

Answer from User 896413:
Yes, there is usually partial credit for questions.

What do you mean by kernel keeps dying? Are you getting an error or are you exceeding the runtime?

There are cases where you will get an empty cluster and that can produce an error. If this is the issue, all you need to do is address this. Remove the empty cluster and continue your run, so you will end up with fewer than 48 clusters when your algorithm finally converges.
