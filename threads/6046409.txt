<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hi - just want to check if the grade for HW1 is available now. I could not see it yet.</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 896413:
No. It will take a while because each assignment has a maximum of 7 extension days, so we cannot begin grading until the extension period is over.

  Comment from User 307528:
  Can we say then by this Sunday or before?

Answer from User 1323477:
Hopefully the grades come out before HW 2 is due. Would love to get feedback and see if I need to improve any of my submission/compiling process or if my code/explanations are enough
