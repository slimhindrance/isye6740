Answer from User 134876:
This course sometimes is unofficially regarded as MLI, while HDDA is unofficially labeled MLII. Both classes have no relation to each other though and there is no continuation, It's just many students consider that course a natural progression, similar to how this course can be seen as a progression from 6040.

Answer from User 136318:
I previous took ML (during OMSCS). I also did DL & ANLP last term. This term I'm taking HDDA with this one. Planning for RL next term. Seems to be an ultimate ML package then (note: I opt-out 3 intro course so will take many of those as replacement credits).
