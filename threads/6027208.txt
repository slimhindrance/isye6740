Answer from User 300188:
Since knowing how to view the data matrix is quite literally the homework question, I'm afraid I can't answer which one should exactly be your row and column in each situation. 

The idea that you should transpose your matrix is fine and accurate though 

While you'll want to remove the country names for PCA, it's important to make sure you can accurately label them back to PCA points on the graph when it's time to draw and make conclusions about the plot.
