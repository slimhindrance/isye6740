I'm finding the wording of question 1.1 below to be a little confusing. I just want to confirm - are we essentially being asked here to list one advantage and one disadvantage for both histograms and KDE? 



  Reply from User 799310:
  Yes, that's correct

Comment from User 1498558:
for part (4) of this question, can we begin the derivation from the expectation f(\theta) provided in the lecture? or are we expevted to also write the full derivation for f(\theta)?

  The first points of Slide 16 of the Density Estimation lecture (Module 3 in Canvas) outlines the beginning of this type of derivation. Slide 16 outlines the approach with samples, $x^i$ being real numbers, whereas with the homework question, $x^i$ represents samples that are vectors (n-dimensional observations). It would be good to show substantial detail for the derivation, as the question notes:

Please show the work for your derivations in full detail.
