I'm wondering if this means the instructor hasn't posted the grades yet or if there's another reason why it's not displaying. Could you clarify?</paragraph><paragraph>Thanks for your help!</paragraph><paragraph>Best,</paragraph><paragraph>Dailu Hou</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 962232:
Is this for HW1? If so, the grades haven't been released yet which is why they are not displayed yet.

  Comment from User 1325825:
  No, It is the course grade on canvas where is at up right corner. it shows N/A.
