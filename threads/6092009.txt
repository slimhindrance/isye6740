Answer from User 1512049:
Sorry, but I read somewhere that they don't give the correct answer

Answer from User 134876:
We won't post answers, but we will be hosting a Homework review session, generally ~2 weeks after it's deadline. The first review session will be this thursday during Chris's office hours.
