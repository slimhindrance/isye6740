<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hi TAs,</paragraph><paragraph>I may be asking this again but that's because of lack of clarity I have. </paragraph><paragraph>When I am running my code locally, I am using relative path for reading data files but the relative path I have to give is from my workspace root directory. Else my code won't work. I want to understand if I have to reset the file read path before submitting code to something like: </paragraph><paragraph>"./data/football.bmp" or what I have currently "./Q3/data/football.bmp" is also acceptable. </paragraph><paragraph>My zip file structure is like: </paragraph><paragraph>tkumar70_HW1</paragraph><paragraph>tkumar70_HW1/Q3</paragraph><paragraph>tkumar70_HW1/Q3/Q3.py</paragraph><paragraph>tkumar70_HW1/Q3/data/football.bmp</paragraph><paragraph/><paragraph>and so on for Q4 and Q5. </paragraph><paragraph/></document>

Answer from User 134876:
In general, our working directory is your unzipped code folder, so your scripts should be able to run from the tkumar70_HW1 folder. We are more lenient on HW1, so if your code runs from the tkumar70_HW1/Q3 folder that is okay for this assignment, as it is still using relative paths and isn't determinate on a path specific to your system.
