Answer from User 896413:
Hi Luis,

Your assigned TA is Neepa. We do not send notifications about assignments, but you can see it in Canvas under the People tab.

HW1 grades will be released soon.

You do not need to communicate with the staff about your project. All you need to do is register for a group (see #29) and submit your project proposal when it releases. Be sure to read the peer review guidelines doc in Canvas because it also has the grading rubric on it.

Your homework grading TA will be different from your project TA. Project TAs have not been assigned yet.
