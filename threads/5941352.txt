Hello, I'm posting about question 2. I've gone over the section in the lecture that discusses similarity functions. I get that generally euclidian distance is used for numerical data, and hamming distance is used for categorical data for measuring the distance between a data point and centroid.

In the lecture, "d(x, y) = formula" is basically saying "distance = formula" correct? 

Overall I'm really trying but I don't get how to approach answering this question. I can't really find anywhere in the lectures where the instructor talks about combining similarity functions. I wish I could provide more of a question besides "where do I even begin here?" but that's where I'm at after spending a couple hours trying to research this.

I suppose I should also state that my math is just terrible... I can tell this is gonna be a huge issue for me in this course. While I studied the pre-requisites intensely before starting this program (about 2 years ago), I've never done math derivations before and don't even know where to begin answering those types of questions. Sorry I know this is unrelated but I'm already starting to feel pretty overwhelmed and we're not even through the first week. I feel I don't really struggle with the programming and understanding how these models work, but the the actual nitty gritty math... I'm legitimately questioning if I'm capable of doing this.

Sorry, I know this is kinda all over the place but I'm willing to bet there are other students feeling similarly right now.

  Hey Keith,

Your first point is correct.  d(x,y) is just the math way of referring to some kind of distance function, but the right hand side of the equal sign tells you which specific function it's referring to.  For instance,

$$d(x,y)=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-y_i)^2}$$

basically says, "my distance function is the Euclidean one," or

$$d(x,y)=\min_{i=1}^{n}\big|x_i-y_i\big|$$

means, "my distance function is the inf-distance one," (L2-Slide 24).

Next, the act of combining can refer to different things mathematically, but think about situations in real life where you combine things together.  What math might be appropriate if you combined 2 apples with 3 apples?  Or, what math might you need if you had to find the combined cost of 3 apples @ $5/apple with 2 oranges @ $4/orange?  

These are just food for thought -- there are lots of other ways to "combine" things in real life and depending on the circumstances they can use kinds of different math.

Hopefully that helps.  You can do it :)

Hello, 

I have questions about HW1. I saw we can submit the HW by Assignments and Gradesscope. For questions 3,4,5, if we submit by gradescope, do we still need to resubmit by assgiment as well?



  Reply from User 300188:
  Yes. Per #34 , you submit to both Canvas and Gradescope.

Is normalization required for the similarity function? (q2)

  Reply from User 284691:
  There are a variety of reasonable ways to construct the similarity function and to combine the binary and real-valued features. Depending on how you choose to combine the features, normalization may be necessary so that some features don't dominate the results. 

Comment from User 962158:
For Q1.2,

Do we need to come up with a way to account for every possible city in our binary representation of the city feature or are we just concerned with using the first binary feature to represent either Atlanta or Dallas?



  Reply from User 896413:
  You may interpret it any way you wish, as long as it accounts for the two given data points $x^1$ and $x^2$. What is more important is your explanation and computation for the final similarity measure.

Question 1.1 on the homework for this week asks for 3 advantages and 2 limitations of supervised and unsupervised learning. Do we need to pull this directly from lecture, or are all correct answers acceptable?

  Reply from User 896413:
  All correct answers are acceptable, although it is recommended to answer it using your understanding from the lecture.

Q1.3
Trying to solve the Q1.3 but kind of lost here. I tried chapter 14.3.6 page 509 of the ESLII book, also the chapter 9.1 page 424 of Bishop - Pattern Recognition with no success. Can anyone point me to the right place to find the explanation for this question?

  Reply from User 1497720:
  It would help if you understand that minimising over a variable means that you may ignore other independent variables. Also minimising z is the same as minimising z/10. Also basic algebraic identities! 

  Reply from User 1512055:
  If you rewrite the terms as vectors (paying close attention to the squared terms) you might be able to find the solution.

Question 1.6 

Can I use a tool like Python to solve for the eigenvalues once I've come up with the Laplacian matrix? Or do we need to do it manually by hand for full points? Thanks!

  Reply from User 134876:
  You can use python to validate your calculations, but you should be showing your math in the report.

Q1.2:

Is it correct to interpret the question as simply stating what similarity function we would want to use for the given data points and our rationale for why we pick that similarity function? Are mathematical derivations required to support our rationale? 



  Reply from User 213547:
  You can state the similarity function as well show how that works for this question with the results in numerical value. 

Comment from User 1544230:
Hi, I am posting about question 3, part 3. The question asks us to describe how to find the best k. I am wondering if the best k means that the best k out of 3,6,12,24,48 or best k in general? And is any calculation needed or does description suffice? Thank you so much!

  Anna's answer in the HW1 Q3 thread is relevant



Comment from User 896416:
Any tips for students who've never written a proof before on how to approach question 3? 

  Reply from User 215365:
  The word show used in the homework gives a hint that this will involve mathematically going step by step to demonstrate that the two mathematical expressions are equivalent. Proofs can involve definitions and algebraic manipulations and other steps. You should be able to justify why you can make the change that happens to the mathematical expression at each step and for some important steps, you may need to explicitly state that reason.
