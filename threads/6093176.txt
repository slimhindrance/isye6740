Comment from User 896123:
For Q2.1, I want to clarify the wording of the question "Form the 1-dimensional histogram and KDE to estimate the distributions of amygdala and acc, respectively." Does this mean form a 1-D histogram of the amygdala variable and a 1-D KDE of the acc variable? Or should we form a 1-D histogram and a 1-D KDE for each variable?



  Reply from User 1128373:
  I interpreted it as the latter, so 4 graphs:

1-D histogram for amygdala

1-D histogram for acc

1-D KDE for amygdala

1-D KDE for acc

Comment from User 1497720:
Why does the K function exist since it looks like the normal distribution notation N(xi,h^2) makes the (1/h)*K((xi-x)/h) term redundant? Can't we just write p(x) = 1/m sig_{i=1}^m N(xi,h) ? 

  Reply from User 799310:
  I wouldn't necessarily call it redundant. You make a good point about the normal distribution notation, however keeping K the way it is emphasizes its general, nonparametric aspect and allows for different kernel choices beyond gaussian (although I believe this problem is just Gaussian)



Comment from User 1497720:
For 2.1 can the h be different for each? I know that in 2.2 this is not physically possible however in the 1D case should we tune individually for better results? 

(edit: I think it is physically possible to have different 1/Delta1 and 1/Delta2 for the histogram and even h1 and h2 for the KDE however I think the KDE in the assingment is a special case of h1 = h2  ? Is this true? )

  Reply from User 215365:
  Since you are dealing with each variable, amygdala and acc, individually (the 1D case as you said), the optimal value of h could be different for each variable with Q2.1. These variables are measuring the volumes of brain regions so they could be on different scales.

Comment from User 1128044:
2.4: Can you clarify conditional sample mean? Are we supposed to score the same data points use to fit the KDE for their weights and compute the average? Or should be use sample n points from a range (conditional set?...full data set?)

2.5: Same sort of thinking for this question, are we supposed to show a contour plot with n sampled points across the entire data range or the conditional range?





  Reply from User 215365:
  The conditional sample mean is the sample mean of either the variable amygdala or acc with the orientation fixed at a certain value (2,3,4 or 5). So the first column of the table (c=2) would have the mean value for amygdala and acc of those students with an orientation = 2.

Similarly, for Q2.5, conditioning on the orientation $c$ will involve looking at the joint distribution for those students with that orientation of $c$. This question should include four plots.
