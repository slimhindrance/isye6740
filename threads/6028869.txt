Please refer to https://edstem.org/us/courses/70719/discussion/5950315, Gradescope is strictly optional this semester.

  Thank you so much Mark!!! I was so worried :')

Have a good night and happy weekends!!!

  Comment from User 1133866:
  Hi, I have one more quick follow-up question: 

If I submit on gradescope and it return me 0 points (because of file naming issue, but now I see it is optional so I decide to not continue submitting my codes on Gradescope anymore), will that affect my grade even if it runs successfully on TA's laptop?

Just want to double-check. Thank you!!
