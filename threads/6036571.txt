<document version="2.0"><paragraph>I am a bit confused about this question and the solution in the lecture. I think I am just missing something conceptually... I follow the transformation steps of the objective to get the form w^T C w. But then I dont understand why you are able to just add in the extra term to turn it into the Langrangian function. I can see why it's helpful, I just dont understand why it's allowed to get to that step, and then just add new stuff to the equation.</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 497513:
I assume you are referring to the reformulation of original objective function with constrains into the Lagrangian function. 

The rational of procedure is based on the Lagrange multiplier theorem. You can find more details in below reference.
