<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hi, when testing for the face calculation for each eigenface vs test image, I noticed that sometimes, the residual when comparing the test images with the top 6 eigenfaces of subject 1, the residual between the first test image and the eigenface of subject 1 is larger than the one between the second test image and the eigenface of subject 1. I know that the eigenfaces of subject 1 should have lower residuals when compared with test image 1. A similar occurrence happens with the test images and subject 2's top eigenfaces. I have two images that show this issue, the first image for subject 1 and the second image for subject 2.</paragraph><figure><image src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/Ep2X07M0UgRR4UZqnBrbqpav" width="340" height="220"/></figure><paragraph>                                   Residuals between Test images and subject 1 eigen faces</paragraph><figure><image src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/hwtlIgkiFT4R9R8RGMag4z3T" width="346" height="208"/></figure><paragraph>                                 Residuals between Test images and subject 2 eigen faces</paragraph><paragraph/></document>

Answer from User 962232:
Are you sure you sorted your eigenvectors correctly?

  Comment from User 962322:
  I redid my PCA algorithm and ended up sorting the eigenvectors like so:

I'm still getting the same results. I am also following the advice that Brent gave in the HW 2 Q4 thread for the residual equation:

If there are any other suggestions that would be great!



Answer from User 213547:
Are you following this sequence

S1 eigenface test image S1

S1 eigenface test image S2

S2 eigenface test image S1

S2 eigenface test image S2

  Comment from User 962322:
  Sorry wanted to mark this as resolved. I ended up pulling the equation apart and doing it outside of calling a function in a loop and ended up with better values.
