Dear Dayoon Sug, 

I can see that your submission for HW2 was submitted at 11:59 p.m.; however, you've only submitted a .zip file. A 10-point penalty is applied to all assignments that do not include both a .pdf and a .zip file. 



I recommend that you resubmit the assignment and include both required files: the .zip and .pdf. 

Thank you!

Best regards, 

Alex Nanni

  Dear Alexander,

Thank you for your response to my post.

For HW1 and HW2, I understood the syllabus as requiring PDF files to be included in the zip folder, so I submitted them within the zipfolder. I apologize for my misunderstanding.

Could you kindly let me know what would happen with this case?

I appreciate your time and assistance.

Best regards,
Dayoon Sug

  Dear Alex,

Thank you for your clarification regarding my inquiry.

Regarding HW1, I was unable to upload the file separately. As for HW2, I have reuploaded both the zip file and the PDF file for your grading.

I appreciate your time and assistance.

Kind regards,
Dayoon
