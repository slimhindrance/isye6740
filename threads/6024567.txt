Answer from User 1497720:
Also is there a particular value of epsilon for which we should plot this or is that upto us? Unless you want us to complete all parts, find a 'good' epsilon value in the rest of the parts and then come back and do this part. 

  Comment from User 300188:
  Up to you. And the approach you mentioned afterwards is fine for this problem. 

Answer from User 300188:
You can visualize the adjacency matrix as a heat map and then illustrate some images associated with the points in the heatmap

OR

You can plot the graph and illustrate what the nodes are. 

Either way, you have to illustrate a few images on both options.
