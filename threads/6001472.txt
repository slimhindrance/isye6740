I do want to give this my best shot but also want to know if realistically there is any chance I pass this class.</paragraph><paragraph>Thank you,</paragraph><paragraph>Pranav</paragraph><paragraph> </paragraph></document>

 Hi Pranav,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns—it's great that you're being proactive about improving your understanding. Here are a few steps and resources that might help:

Revisit the Basics for linear algebra and statistics. There are many online resources which can help to explains concepts in an approachable and practical way.

Begin with simpler examples or exercises before tackling more complex problems in the assignment. Breaking down tasks into smaller steps can make them feel more manageable.

Attending office hours is one of the best ways to get personalized guidance. You’re not alone in feeling unsure—office hours are designed to help students navigate challenges like this. Feel free to let us know your concerns in advance if it helps you feel more comfortable.
