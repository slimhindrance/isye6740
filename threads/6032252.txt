<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hello all,</paragraph><paragraph>Marking this as private so I don't give too much away.  I'm trying to nail down the bonus and I feel like I'm close but can't seem to close it out.</paragraph><paragraph>After a bunch of math, I get to this point:</paragraph><paragraph>Now, if we consider eigenvectors for C: $$ C w_1 = \lambda w_1 $$ $$ (\tilde{C} - \mu \mu^T) w_1 = \lambda w_1 $$ $$ \tilde{C} w_1 - \mu \mu^T w_1 = \lambda w_1 $$ $$ \tilde{C} w_1 = \mu \mu^T w_1 +\lambda w_1 $$</paragraph><paragraph>Therefore, $w_1$ can be an eigenvector of $\tilde{C}$ iff $\mu\mu^T$ scales $w_1$, because only then does the sum $ \mu \mu^T w_1 +\lambda w_1$ scale $w_1$ without changing its direction.</paragraph><paragraph>If $\mu\mu^T$ is the zero matrix, then we have the trivial case where $C = \tilde{C}$ and so of course $w_1$ is an eigenvector of $\tilde{C}$.</paragraph><paragraph>If $\mu\mu^T$ is a nonzero matrix, then it must be such that it scales $w_1$ as $C$ does, in the same direction. This can only be accomplished if $\mu\mu^T$ is a elementwise scalar multiple of C.  (*note - is this true?)</paragraph><paragraph/><paragraph>Any advice from here, or am I headed the wrong direction?  I feel like I should be able to argue that $\mu\mu^T$ scaling $w_1$ is not guaranteed but I don't have a good argument/counterexample.</paragraph><paragraph>Since code submission is not accepted for the bonus I'm assuming finding a counterexample using code and writing it out by hand is also not acceptable.</paragraph><paragraph>Appreciate any advice or insight - thank you!</paragraph><paragraph/><paragraph/><paragraph>Edit:  Does this do the trick?</paragraph><paragraph>$$ \tilde{C} w_1 = \mu \mu^T w_1 +\lambda w_1 $$</paragraph><paragraph>If you apply $\mu\mu^T$ to any vector you end up with a scalar multiple of $\mu$. Therefore, we can write this as: $$ \tilde{C} w_1 = c\mu +\lambda w_1 $$</paragraph><paragraph>Now, it is immediately clear that $\tilde{C}$ has eigenvector $w_1 \implies \mu$ is a scalar multiple of $w_1$, as $\mu$ must align with $w_1$ or their sum will point a different direction than $w_1$. Therefore, $w_1 = \tilde{w_1}$ only if $mu$ is in alignment with $w_1$. This means in the general case, we are not guaranteed that $w_1 = \tilde{w_1}$.</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 497513:
We can't do proof reading, though I find your approach promising.

  Thank you Pengfei!
