Answer from User 213547:
Please reach out to the dean as this is a special case

  Comment from User 679048:
  Thank you Neepa for your response! I guess I was not clear in my message, just my addled brain not working properly... I have already submitted the HW and I am 2 days late.

I did not realize that I will need to get Dean permission for this -- I thought we had 10 days (7 max per HW) automatic extension? I have already submitted my HW - so I guess should I delete those files or let them be?
