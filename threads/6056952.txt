<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hello, I am writing to inform you that I underwent surgery a couple of days before the beginning of this semester. The recovery process has caused some delays in my ability to start my courses on time. I have noticed that project teams have already been formed, and I am wondering if it would be possible for me to work on the project independently.</paragraph><paragraph/></document>

Answer from User 215365:
Yes, you can work on the project independently. Refer to Project Guidelines to see how to form a group (of one). Also, you could look at Finding a Project team, if you still want to try to find other students to form a team with.
