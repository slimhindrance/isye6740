<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hello,</paragraph><paragraph>I was just wondering whether the code we submit in Canvas requires the same classes, functions, libraries, output, and/or file names as the scaffolding code templates provided for Gradescope. I did not use them for Homework 1, and I wonder if this was a mistake since I have not received a grade yet.</paragraph><paragraph>Thanks,</paragraph><paragraph>Victor</paragraph><paragraph/></document>

Answer from User 213547:
