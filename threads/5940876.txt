McCade Pearson here based out of SLC, UT. I am relatively flexible in terms of communication and time. My day-to-day job is statistical customer research for a convenience store with just under 1000 locations. I feel super super strong in R, my Python is good enough and then I have a variety of other skills. I have huge amount of personal project experience in the sports world.

Hi everyone! My name is Dominique, and I'm currently living in Lexington, KY. 

Time Zone: EST, but flexible 

Communication: Text or Teams, but open to other platforms

Skills: I've worked with R, SQL, Python, LaTeX and have several other skills stemming from my Operations Research degree. I feel I have a pretty strong Python background as I've worked with libraries for machine learning, simulation, web scraping, sentiment analysis, and interactive visualizations for several projects/assignments.

Experience: I've done machine learning research projects in the past, mainly focusing on financial and real estate markets. I've done well in ISYE 6501, CSE 6040, and CSE 6242. Again, I did my undergrad in Operations Research at Columbia University, so I've taken machine learning, data visualization, simulation, optimization, statistical analysis, finance, and business-related classes recently.

Project Topic: I would love to work on a project related to sports analytics (mainly interested in the NBA and soccer), but I'm also open to other areas of interest (e.g., gaming, media analysis, education, sociology, etc).

That being said, I'm detail-oriented, insightful, and a fast learner. So if anyone wants to team up, you can reply to this message or shoot me an email at dmorris46@gatech.edu.

  Hi Dominique! I'm interested in joining your group. My name is Kayla and I'm currently located in Boston, MA.

Time Zone: EST

Communication: Text, Teams, Outlook, Zoom, Discord-- whatever works best for you

Skills: I've worked with R and Python throughout my time in the program. My last class worked with R so I'll be sure to dust off the Python syntax, haha.  I've also worked a bit with MATLAB in undergrad. I have a strong background in math and can learn very quickly. 

Experience: I earned my undergrad in Physics where I worked with MATLAB in my computational physics course and others. This is my 8th class in the program and I've done well in all. 

Project Topic: I'm open to any topic! All the ones you've listed sound interesting, especially media analysis, education, and sociology. I'm cool with sports analytics too since I've never studied that before :)

I take pride in being able to communicate well and often. Let me know if you'd like to team up! (kmasozera3@gatech.edu)

  Hey Dominique and Kayla! If you are still open to a third I'd be interested in teaming up with you two. 

Time Zone: I'm located in Michigan, so EST as well

Communication: Whatever works! 

Skills: SQL and Python are my jam and I use those pretty much daily in my 9-5. I have experience building linear programming and simulation models from scratch as well as using various packages for random other projects. 

Experience: Senior Data Analyst in the financial lending space, currently working on transitioning to a Data Scientist role at my company. This is my 5th class in the program. 

Project Topic: All in on sports analytics! I may have scrolled far enough to find the first person saying they were interested in sports analytics, who's to say :)

Experience

I’m a Senior Data Analyst at Mazda North American Operations. This is my 6th course in the program. Last semester, I completed DVA, where I led the modeling efforts for our group project. I was responsible for building and implementing several machine learning models, evaluating their accuracy metrics, and comparing their performance. Using scraped data provided by other team members, I troubleshot issues to ensure the models produced clean, reliable results, which we analyzed for our final project.

Communication

I’m flexible with communication methods—email (plam35@gatech.edu), Slack, WhatsApp, text, or others. However, I believe Slack would work best as our primary communication tool.

Time Zone

Eastern Standard Time (EST)
I’m available for daily, weekly, or biweekly meetings as needed during most evenings after 5 PM, Monday through Friday. I’m also flexible on weekends with proper scheduling.

Skills

Programming: Python, SQL, R

Visualization Tools: Tableau, Power BI

Project Topic

I’m open to exploring any project topics and excited to collaborate with you all!

Looking forward to working with everyone!

Best,
Philip

  Hi Michael,

I am interested in joining your project team! I am located in Atlanta Georgia so our time zones would align. This is my 7th course in the program and have taken all of the core, advanced core, and the regression analysis course. 

I am currently a senior data analyst for home depot and primarily work with supply chain data but do have an interest in the financial sector which is why I would love to team up with you. 

I am also taking the Machine learning for trading course this semester which I believe I would be able to apply some of that knowledge to our project ( if we decide to do a project in the financial industry)

I also currently work from home so my availability would be pretty open for the most part. Let me know if you would like to work together.

Thanks!

Hi all! 

My name is Justin. I live in Phoenix, AZ, and I currently work as a data scientist / energy demand forecaster for a major utility company. I'm looking to work on something related to the energy sector (more details below). Please reach out if you're interested in learning more about me and interested in possibly working together! 

Time Zone: Mountain Standard Time (Phoenix, AZ)

Communication: Ed, Slack, Teams, FaceTime, Email, Phone,

Experience: Currently work as a data scientist forecasting energy demand for a major utility company. Previous experience in data analytics in emergency management. Undergraduate degree in Econ and Math. Graduated Highest Honors.

Classes taken: ISYE 6501, CSE 6040, ISYE 6644 (Simulation), ISYE 6420 (Bayes), ISYE 6203 - As in all

Skills: Proficient in Python (NumPy, Pandas, several other packages), SQL, Tableau / Power BI, and Microsoft Office Suite (including advanced Excel). Also strong with R but may take me a minute to get back into the swing of things with that language. Strong quantitative / mathematical background in general. 

Project Topic: I am interested in just about anything related to the energy sector - forecasting energy demand, optimizing generation resources, analyzing renewable energy resources (e.g., solar and wind), etc. I'm also interested in the intersection of public utilities and emergency management such as using machine learning algorithms to better plan for and mitigate disasters such as the wildfires we are sadly seeing in Southern California right now. (I think some image detection algorithms could be applied here? Not too familiar with the tech at the moment, but it interests me.)

Hi everyone, 

Phillip McElroy and I are looking for a third person to join our project team since our original partner had to drop the class for this semester. 

We are interested in doing something related to the energy industry. Please see a little summary about us below and let us know if you're interested ASAP. Our emails are justin.rodriguez110@gatech.edu and pmcelroy3@gatech.edu. Thank you!

About me: 

I live in Phoenix, AZ, and I currently work as a senior data scientist / energy demand forecaster for a major utility company. I'm looking to work on something related to the energy sector (more details below). Please reach out if you're interested in learning more about me and interested in possibly working together! 

Time Zone: Mountain Standard Time (Phoenix, AZ)

Communication: Ed, Slack, Teams, FaceTime, Email, Phone,

Experience: Currently work as a data scientist forecasting energy demand for a major utility company. Previous experience in data analytics in emergency management. Undergraduate degree in Econ and Math. Graduated Highest Honors.

Classes taken: ISYE 6501, CSE 6040, ISYE 6644 (Simulation), ISYE 6420 (Bayes), ISYE 6203 - As in all

Skills: Proficient in Python (NumPy, Pandas, several other packages), SQL, Tableau / Power BI, and Microsoft Office Suite (including advanced Excel). Also strong with R but may take me a minute to get back into the swing of things with that language. Strong quantitative / mathematical background in general. 

Project Topic: I am interested in just about anything related to the energy sector - forecasting energy demand, optimizing generation resources, analyzing renewable energy resources (e.g., solar and wind), etc. I'm also interested in the intersection of public utilities and emergency management such as using machine learning algorithms to better plan for and mitigate disasters such as the wildfires we are sadly seeing in Southern California right now. (I think some image detection algorithms could be applied here? Not too familiar with the tech at the moment, but it interests me.)
