If we submit to Gradescope, do we still have to submit the same code in the standard submission format (zip file) along with our report for Q1? 

  Reply from User 134876:
   Yes, The gradescope submission is an additional submission, The submission to canvas with zip + report is still the primary form of submission. Once you have your gradescope code working, you can use the same code for your canvas report submission.

Are we allowed to add methods to the given class? 

  Reply from User 672141:
  Adding new methods to classes is ok, but not removing existing ones.

  This test uses output very similar to how PCA case is being handled. I suggest debugging your code further to fix the issue

Comment from User 1133602:
Because scipy is in the requirements.txt file, could I use statements such as the following in my code to only pull in certain modules such as "from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist" and will that work in Gradescope? 

  Reply from User 979414:
  yes

Comment from User 962039:
For Q4, I'm getting a shape error, it seems to be looking for (6,60,80), but with the downsampling package I'm using to reduce by 4, it's not rounding down the 243 pixels to 60, but to 61 (e.g. (6,61,80). Is this also an acceptable answer or does it have to downsample the 243 by 4 and round it down to the nearest integer as opposed to just rounding to the nearest integer?



  Reply from User 979414:
  It has to be matching gradescope test dimensions 

Comment from User 1512062:
Hi team, I'll like to ask a few questions for HW2 gradescope:
1. Where can I redownload the updated Gradescope scafffolding zip file for HW2?
2. I see on Gradescope submission for HW2 where it's only one submission place unlike in HW1 with 3 submission places for each question. Does this mean we have to submit a ZIP file including the requirements.txt and all the 3 PY files?
Additionally, may I check if the following packages are supported for all 3 questions:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- matplotlib
- PIL
- scipy
- os
- skimage (scikit-image)

Thanks team

  Reply from User 979414:
  Everything except `skimage (scikit-image)` is supported by gradescope. What is the feature that you would need from skimage ? 



Comment from User 1230103:
There is no plot function in the py files provided by scaffolding, do we need to add it by ourselves or is plotting optional for Gradecope submission?



  Reply from User 1512057:
  Gradescope will call your methods and produce plots in the output, so I have plot methods for myself for my report but they're not needed for the Gradescope submission.

Comment from User 1230103:
For Question 4, do we need to adjust our code to match the expected shape of the output in Gradescope to get the bonus? 



  Reply from User 672141:
  Yes, when you downsample the image it goes from 243x320 to 61x80.



Comment from User 307048:
Do we leave the line in each function that says NotImplementedError?

  Reply from User 962232:
  No. Once you complete the implementation of the function, you should remove the NotImplementedError line.

Comment from User 307048:
I'm using a couple extension days for HW2. Will we still be able to submit to Gradescope for the bonus points past tonight's deadline?

  Reply from User 300188:
  Yes. 

Comment from User 1271302:
Sorry if this question has been asked before. The Autograder Score shows 5.0/5.0, but the Total Points shows -/5. Am I missing something, or am I good to go?"




  Reply from User 962232:
  You will get the points for passing the autograder tests for the bonus points, but that does not necessarily mean your results are the expected results for the question that will be graded for the question points.

Comment from User 1332929:
I cant seem to pass the 3.4 test (ISOMAP scatter plot) and keep getting this error:



Im confused since i am not using any dictionary in my code and also my code for the PCA scatterplot passed .

  Reply from User 979414:
  Seems like there was some issue with your code and its resolved now
