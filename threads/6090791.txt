Answer from User 307599:
 Hi Jonas,

Thank you for your question. Yes, if HWX was submitted on time but the Gradescope code was submitted three days late, those three days will be deducted from your extension days.

  Hi Reeti! 

This is a little discouraging, but thanks for getting back to me. 

Have a great week!
