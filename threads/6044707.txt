<document version="2.0"><paragraph>For 3.1, aren't the 2 parts of the question independent from one another? Plotting the image of the adjacency matrix (what I'm doing) is different than selecting a node and plotting the resulting image/face. These are 2 disconnected tasks? The question makes it sound like we need to first plot the adjacency matrix and then it becomes possible to plot certain nodes, when in reality, we can plot the node images even before plotting the adjacency matrix? I say this because "at different parts of the graph" threw me off.</paragraph><paragraph>For example, out of the 698 images, I can just plot the first one. Aka the first face. I don't need an adjacency matrix to tell me how to do that -- that seems like it's own separate thing.</paragraph><paragraph>ADDITIONALLY, do you have any tips for adjusting epsilon? I looked through TA Neepa's OH and found nothing, though I could be missing something.</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 896413:
For 3.1, no, these are connected. The instructions say "illustrate a few images corresponds to nodes at different parts of the graph". You may choose to do the adjacency matrix, networkx graph, or a gephi visualization, but it must have the corresponding images.

Plot the adjacency matrix. Then put images on where the related node appears. You can do something similar to this poorly drawn example:
