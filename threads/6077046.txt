Answer from User 300188:
No approval necessary.

Just don't end up replicating any results/analysis that's already been done in that code part of that dataset. You need to try to bring up a novel approach to it (doesn't have to be successful per se). The main idea is that you want to show that you deeply thought about your project. 



  Comment from User 1230259:
  Of course, in fact I believe the dataset that we found doesn't actually have an analysis done, just a brief description of the data and what the recommendation is. 

Thank you very much for the reply.
