Answer from User 799310:
Good question. In general, the best way to know would be to test it directly. For instance, you could copy and paste your folder into a different part of your computer and then try running the code. That being said, I think the screenshot you shared would likely work on Windows computers but not on Mac or Linux. I believe os.path.join() would be a better option.

For your second question, are there certain file types you are having trouble importing? 

  Comment from User 1144014:
  Thanks! I guess some follow up questions; by copying and pasting my folder, do you mean by trying to run the script with the data folder in a different active directory? 

Are our codes expected to be able to run on all platforms? Windows, Mac and Linux?

Clarifying my second question, I'm not having too many issues with the importing files necessarily, I just noticed that from demo code and Googling import examples depending on file type (Image, .txt, or .csv, etc) the examples of commands used vary depending on file type. And this is compounded by my worry if my script will be able to be run on any other computer for grading, hence my ask of if there's generic commands we can reference to standardize/reduce this worry.
