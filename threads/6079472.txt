Answer from User 1127977:
I agree!

Answer from User 134876:
HW1 is still actively being graded currently, so it is unlikely that grades will be released today. My general advice is to ensure that you follow submission requirements listed on the syllabus, follow all instructions on the assignment, and answer clearly what the questions are asking and you should not need to be concerned. We try to ensure the questions are straight forward, and our grading is fair.
