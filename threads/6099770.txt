Answer from User 134876:
Hello AnnaMaria,

Have you contacted the dean of students office like we previously suggested? Without that contact, we are unable to accept any HW1 at this point. Additionally, We will be covering HW1 solutions on Thursday, so nothing will be accepted after that regardless.
