<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hi there, </paragraph><paragraph>I am beginning to think of some project ideas and found a dataset that I would really like to work with. It involves used car sales data, with a variety of numerical and categorical variables, including the following:</paragraph><list style="unordered"><list-item><paragraph>Year</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Make</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Model</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Trim</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Body</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Transmission</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>VIN</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>State</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Condition</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Odometer</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Exterior Color</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Interior Color</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Seller</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>MMR</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Selling price</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Sale date</paragraph></list-item></list><paragraph>I am a bit stuck on the appropriate “scope” of the question we are trying to answer. In general, I can be a bit… verbose when it comes to reporting. I can think of several more “surface-level” investigations that are interesting, such as the correlation between any one factor and car price, but there are obviously a lot of directions this can go. The issue is that answering one of these questions provides a lot of the information to answer another one, so I want to make sure I am not falling down a rabbit hole answering too many questions.</paragraph><list style="unordered"><list-item><paragraph>To what degree of accuracy can we predict the sale price of a used car? </paragraph></list-item><list-item><list style="unordered"><list-item><paragraph>This could involve k-fold cross validation and a discussion of whether a regression model using all variables versus a select few principle components with PCA yields better results (e.g. MSE, MAE, etc.)</paragraph></list-item></list></list-item><list-item><paragraph>What are the most important features that drive a car’s price?

Does any one of these investigations seem more or less interesting to you as reviewers? For example, if the first question was answered, we would then have several models and we could see which is best for predicting price. Would this be sufficient or would I then need to do something more in depth like clustering to see if individual listings are overpriced, underpriced, or appropriately priced based on their deviation from the prices that our model predicts.</paragraph><paragraph>Thanks!</paragraph><paragraph>Ross</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 962232:
This looks pretty good to me. The scope of the project is pretty flexible to whatever you ware trying to achieve. All of the questions looks interesting to me as a reviewer. The level of detail looks more than sufficient to me, so I would suggest that you focus on just one of those areas and then if you have time begin to explore more results using your model implementations.

  Sounds good, thanks Evan!
