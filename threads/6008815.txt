<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hello CDA TAs,</paragraph><paragraph>I will be taking this class in a future semester but dropped this class in the first week this semester. I'm sure it is process to clean up Ed for people like me. I just wanted to call myself out because it feels wrong to be in the discussion boards when I'm not in the class. I didn't see a way to drop myself from Ed for this class. Please tell me if I'm incorrect about that.</paragraph><paragraph>Thank you,</paragraph><paragraph>Andrea</paragraph></document>

Comment from User 134876:
I have re-synced ED with Canvas, which caused 133 students to drop off. This message is for the other TA's, because theoretically you should not see this anymore :)
