<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Wasn't sure if this was ok to post in HW2 Q3 topic so sending private first. I wanted to make sure I am interpreting the ['image'] array properly so attempted to visualize the first image. The homework question says an image is stored as a "row in the file" but when I look at the shape it is (4096, 698) which seems to imply that a column vector would be a single 64x64 image. First question is if my interpretation on the dimensions is correct?</paragraph><paragraph>Second question, to visualize the first image I sliced the first column of 4096 rows, reshaped into a 64x64 array, took the transpose then displayed using matplotlib. I got the following image: </paragraph><figure><image src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/4YhmkdEhhaxEw8ilPzdkjXRQ" width="417" height="410"/></figure><paragraph>Is that the correct orientation of the first image? When I first tried this I didn't transpose the 64x64 matrix and the image was facing the other way but rotated counterclockwise like so:</paragraph><figure><image src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/3bKfOxjsdaFVyb7LCsKT45Pf" width="417" height="413"/></figure><paragraph>So I am curious if transpose was the wrong operation here and I simply need to rotate the matrix clockwise rather than transpose it. Thank you in advance!  </paragraph><paragraph/></document>

Answer from User 497513:
1. Yes, that's correct

2. Sometime the data point is reshaped in different format. You can refer to the parameter order{‘C’, ‘F’, ‘A’}, from numpy.reshape()

https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html

When the data is prepared (reshaped), it might not use the default approach. Thus when you reshape it back with default command of np.reshape(), the result is transposed.
