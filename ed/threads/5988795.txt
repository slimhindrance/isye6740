<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hi! I was having trouble understanding how we go from the first red box equation to the second red box equation, specifically how <bold>theta^T</bold>*xi*xi becomes xi*<bold>xi^T</bold>*theta. I was refreshing on vector multiplication and don't recall any sort of commutative property for the transpose. Is there an obvious math rule I'm missing?

Answer from User 1493072:
Dot product between two vectors is commutative. 

Let's say a = [1,2] and b= [3,4]:

a.b = 1*3+2*4  = 11

b.a = 3*1 + 4*2 = 11

Therefore, theta^T . xi = xi^T.theta and it gives a scalar value. And multiplication between this scalar value (xi^T.theta) and a vector (xi) is also commutative, since it is just scaling the vector.
