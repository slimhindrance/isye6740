<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hi, my name's Mark Patrick, and I'm the current Head TA of ISYE 6740. Before we begin, I’d like to inform you of some of the logistics of the course. Please see the following posts, which go into more detail on various aspects of the course. Much of this can be found in the syllabus, which you should read, but we provide it here for your reference as well.<break/><break/>- Communicating with us (<link href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/70719/discussion/5940875">#2</link>) <break/>- Homework (<link href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/70719/discussion/5940877">#3</link>) <break/>- Project (<link href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/70719/discussion/5940879">#4</link>)<break/><break/>I hope all of the above is helpful to you. Before we go, however, allow me to establish some rules of the road. Professor Xie (or, as we call her, Professor X), and our team of TAs do a lot of work to make CDA an educational and rewarding experience for all of you. In order for us to keep our focus on this work, we ask you to keep the following things in mind.<break/><break/>1. <bold>READ THE SYLLABUS</bold>. I cannot stress this enough. Anything you could want to know about our course policies is there, and knowing it will save both your time and ours. Every semester, some students come to us saying ‘I didn’t know about RULE_FROM_THE_SYLLABUS, please give me back points’…if you do the same as these students did, your request will be ignored. This is especially the case because we have a required syllabus quiz specifically designed to ensure that you read the syllabus. <break/>2. Take our prerequisites (if you don’t know what those are, see above) seriously. It’s not uncommon for students to struggle because their calculus, linear algebra, probability, or Python/MATLAB background is rusty. We find this is especially the case for linear algebra, so we’ll be offering a review session for that early in the semester. Please attend if you need a refresher!<break/>3. Remember to be respectful of Professor X, the TAs, and your peers.<break/><break/>Looking forward to working with all of you!<break/><break/>- Mark</paragraph></document>
