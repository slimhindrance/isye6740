<document version="2.0"><paragraph>When are we expected to get our HW 1 grades? Before the HW 2 due date? No rush, just curious because I know the TAs have a lot to go through. And obviously we have the 7-day grace period as well</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 284691:
We aim to return HW1 (and all homework assignments) a few days after the end of the 7-day grace period. We can't return any assignments until all submissions are complete, and we need time to grade the submissions that are made at the end of the grace period.
