Answer from User 896413:
Please see Module 6 (Density Estimation) slide 13. All videos are available in the Media Gallery.

  Comment from User 1232296:
  Oh I see. It's odd the question doesn't mention that.

But what is it asking us to prove?



Answer from User 134876:
In general, there is nothing this question is asking that doesn't fall within the pre-requisites of the course, MLE knowledge and how to derive their parameters fall within the statistics/calc pre-requisites. It is asking you to show a mathematical proof that the MLE follows the normal distribution, and that the mean and variance parameters are equal to the given formulas.

That being said, we do understand that we touch on this topic a bit in a later lecture, specifically the density estimation lecture Anna has pointed to. Given this, We have discussed with Prof X and she has agreed to replace this question with a different one that better reflects the content of Module 2 that is released alongside HW2.

We intend to have this done by the end of today and have the assignment updated on canvas. We will release a canvas announcement when it is updated.

  Comment from User 1232296:
  That's fine and I don't mind if the question does not align with the current module. The problem is vague instructions lead to wasted time. The question says:

"show that MLE ... following the normal distribution",

it should say:

"show that MLE ... follows the normal distribution". 

Otherwise, it's all good, I'm happy to do this and the new question ðŸ¤“  

  Comment from User 1316216:
  For anyone who has already spent the time reviewing the future lecture and writing up the proof, would you consider bonus points if we keep it as part of our submission?

Thanks!

  The pdf and the tex files in V3 are different. The pdf reflects the change, the tex still has the old question
