Answer from User 284691:
Your intuition is correct — it both makes certain calculations easier (or easier to think about) and it is also a preference. 

There is online discussion about this, e.g., https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1avpbrj/feature_vectors_as_rows_or_columns_in_machine/
