<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hi, </paragraph><paragraph>Wanted to ask a simple question about LaTex. If we need to submit pdfs, and when code required we can submit Jupiter notebooks with explanations. Can we simply use Word with the suggested template format and then save the pdf? </paragraph><paragraph>I am all for learning new things, but I seriously doubt I will ever need to use LaTex since no one in my line of work uses it.</paragraph><paragraph>Thanks a lot.</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 217529:
A Jupyter notebook with markdown, rendered as a pdf is a great way to submit your assignments. If you prefer Word, feel free. 

Remember that the key important feature is legibility and correctness. Imagine you are turning this in to a supervisor or management team. You want it to look good. AIM for that and we’re likely to be quite happy with your work. 

Answer from User 930943:
For what it's worth, I've had I think 3 other classes where LaTex-generated reports were either expected or made completing assignments much faster because templates were provided. So, even if not used in your work, I have found it helpful to put time into learning it.
