I've contacted Bursar's Office and see what i can do to reinstate the course. However, i didn't receive any reply yet and not sure how long it would take to process it. I'm wondering if there is an alternative way to let me submit my homework before ddl?</paragraph><paragraph>Please let me know if any other info is required.</paragraph><paragraph/><paragraph>Thanks,</paragraph><paragraph>Yue Yuan</paragraph><paragraph>email: yyuan384@gatech.edu</paragraph></document>
