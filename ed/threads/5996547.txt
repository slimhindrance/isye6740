Hello!  Can you please clarify what is being asked in 1.4?  More specifically, is the ask that we more fully explain each of these three points from the lecture?  Thanks!



  Reply from User 213547:
  yes. you expand the 3 points

For 1.3 would the identity matrix count as a valid U for the decomposition or did you only want non-I solutions? 

Comment from User 1512055:
I'm a little bit confused about exercise 3. I found two eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors, which give me the first eigenvalue decomposition. What about the second one? Can someone give me a hint about how to find it? 



Comment from User 121859:
Trying to understand what needs to be delivered on 1.2. Does a simple text explaining how to get the second and third directions would suffice?
