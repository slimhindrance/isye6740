Answer from User 134876:
Hello Dominique, please contact myself and Prof X via email, providing the information from ODS. This is the normal process, then we work together with the student to determine whatâ€™s appropriate for the course. Many students with extended time accommodations find that our course policy of 10 extension days is already enough for their purposes.

  Okay, I emailed Professor Xie last week, and she said she'd cc you. The Office of Disability Services already sent a Faculty Notification email last Monday as well. However, I will send another email to both of you with that accommodation request attached.
