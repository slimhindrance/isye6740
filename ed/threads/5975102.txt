I want to know if this is a testing error or if there is something wrong with my code, because
when I run my code on my laptop, it is working fine, no problem.</pre></document>

Answer from User 979414:
Hi Thushar

I checked your submission. You have removed the class KMeansImpl from the code provided to you. 
The gradescope tests expect the submissions without changing the presented signature of the methods / classes

Answer from User 799310:
If you look at the HW1 scaffolding code in Canvas, you'll see there are classes called "KMeansImpl", "PoliticalBlogsClustering", and "MNISTClustering", respectively. It looks like Gradescope can't find those classes in your code which is why you are not passing the texts.

To pass the tests on Gradescope, you need to adjust the format of your code to match the HW1 scaffolding code. If you would like to check out a deep dive on the HW1 scaffolding code, Paresh walked through it on his OH on 1/9.
