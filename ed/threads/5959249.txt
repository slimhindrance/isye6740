<document version="1.0"><paragraph>Hi,<break/>I accidentally registered for this course on OSCAR and then dropped it, but I was still added to the Ed discussion board. I tried to "Unenroll" a couple times from the course using a menu on Ed, but it didn't seem to work.</paragraph><paragraph>Would you be able to remove me, please?<break/>Asking because I am taking DMSL, which has a very similar course number and content - so similar that I've actually mistakenly made a post in this course's board already.</paragraph><paragraph>Thanks,<break/>Julie Puckett</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 134876:
Hello, We do not have the ability to either add or remove students, Usually this is done automatically through canvas enrollment, And it's resynced after the drop deadline for any students that drop/re-add. I can reach out to our canvas/ed support for assistance though.



  Comment from User 930943:
  I just disabled notifications for this course - I think that will provide enough of a buffer between courses to prevent me from opening the wrong one. Thanks, though.
