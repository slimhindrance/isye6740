<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hello Students, </paragraph><paragraph>We again have an additional bonus point opportunity for HW2 via GradeScope submission. This will again be 5 points total, Split evenly across the 3 submitted problems. All additional details regarding this submission are below, please ask any follow up questions in this thread.</paragraph><paragraph/><paragraph>For HW2, the required materials are provided in the <bold>HW2 assignment zip</bold> file. Please follow the instructions below carefully to complete and submit your assignment.<break/> </paragraph><callout type="warning">Gradescope will store the data files under a <code>data</code> folder. Please ensure your code reads any files originating from `data` as root folder. <break/><break/><bold>For Example, if you need to read a file like <code>abc.txt</code> using pandas, you should read it as:</bold></callout><snippet language="py" runnable="true" line-numbers="true"><snippet-file id="code">## Read abc.txt file
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('data/abc.txt')</snippet-file></snippet><paragraph>This will ensure that your code works properly with the data stored in the <code>data</code> folder on Gradescope.<break/><break/><bold>1.

What’s Allowed (but Not Required)</bold><break/><break/>You <bold>may</bold> add more Python files if you need to organize your code further, but this is <bold>not required</bold>.

Comment from User 307048:
If we submit to Gradescope, do we still have to submit the same code in the standard submission format (zip file) along with our report for Q1? 

  Reply from User 134876:
   Yes, The gradescope submission is an additional submission, The submission to canvas with zip + report is still the primary form of submission. Once you have your gradescope code working, you can use the same code for your canvas report submission.

Are we allowed to add methods to the given class? 

  Reply from User 672141:
  Adding new methods to classes is ok, but not removing existing ones.

  This test uses output very similar to how PCA case is being handled. I suggest debugging your code further to fix the issue
