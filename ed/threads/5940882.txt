HW5 walkthrough 3/5/25

Just double-checking: This date is a Wednesday, but Neepa's office hours are on Tuesday otherwise. Is this a typo? 

  Reply from User 134876:
  That does appear to be a typo. Good catch!

Comment from User 1080381:
Hi! Just to confirm, the specialized office hours will also be recorded and posted on Canvas?

  Reply from User 896413:
  Yep, it will be in the same place as all the other office hours. I recommend looking it up by TA and date.

Comment from User 1230089:
Hi, I was wondering if we could request a calculus bootcamp/ review? thanks in advance!

  Reply from User 134876:
  Generally this is considered a required pre-requisite for the course, and while we answer some basic questions throughout on these topics we usually point students towards the additional resources we've provided on canvas.

Our TA Alfie does hold a linear algebra review session, which is as of yet not yet scheduled. What specific topics of calculus do you feel that a review would help you on?

Comment from User 1491916:
Hi, I just want to confirm if all TA office hour will be recorded and posted in Media Gallery? I'm not sure if it's my Chrome issue since it's showing only a few seconds video and no content for a lot of links.

  Reply from User 134876:
  Yes all office hours will be recorded. Sometimes the zoom auto-recorder is weird and puts up random short clips if someone joins at a non-scheduled time. We also aim to put the links to specific sessions directly within this post as well for convenience as we understand the media gallery itself can be overwhelming.

I am online waiting for Paresh's OH today 1/13/25 at 10 am EST. Is it still being held?

  Reply from User 979414:
  Hi Julie 

I had to reschedule the OH at 5 pm ET. 
If you have any questions in mean time please feel free to make a post on ed.  


Comment from User 1512054:
Hey! Is there a way to delete the very short videos (seconds long) from the media gallery? It can be challenging to navigate. Thanks!

  Reply from User 799310:
  Good point. I just cleaned up the media gallery, removing the office hours that looked like they were accidentally started (i.e. just a few seconds long)

Comment from User 896430:
Videos from TAs' office hours are really helpful to us!

Could we standardize the filenames for all Teaching Assistants (TAs) in the Media Gallery? Including the date and a brief note in the filename could let us to follow the videos much easier. For example:

TA_OH_25_0113_Anna_LaTeX_Tutorial.*

TA_OH_25_0***_TAName_Vectorization_for_Implementing_ML_Models.*

Thanks!

  Reply from User 799310:
  I'll bring up this suggestion with the TAs. For now, we've removed the accidentally started office hours (those that lasted only a few seconds) from the media gallery. This should hopefully make it easier to navigate

  Reply from User 134876:
  Unfortunately, Unless we schedule office hours 1 by 1, Zoom has an automatic naming convention that assigns the recording name for every scheduled session.

We do plan to link directly to the sessions that target specific topics in this post to more easily find them.

Comment from User 1128073:
I'm not quite sure how to mark a Resolved item as Unresolved so I'm creating a new comment here, but in reference to this thread, I know the TAs were checking on Alfie's OHs as of 6 days ago---any updates on this?  I'm particularly interested in the linear algebra review session.



  Reply from User 134876:
  Hi David, Thank you for following up. Unfortunately, it appears that we've had some last minute TA changes, It is not a certainty as of yet whether or not Alfie will be joining us.

I am currently working on getting the materials Alfie normally used for this review up onto the website we have put together, so students can still benefit from the review materials though we may not yet have a replacement to cover the entire session.

Hi, I'm getting access denied when clicking on the links above. I was able to access them yesterday, any idea what's going on? Thanks!

  Reply from User 962232:
  I think it's something weird with Kaltura being built in to Canvas. You can still access all of the linked videos from the Media Gallery.

Comment from User 1080381:
Hello! When will we get the times for the Homework Solutions review OH? 

  Reply from User 134876:
  Solutions reviews will be scheduled after all students have had an opportunity to submit, earliest possible is always a week after the due date barring any special circumstances considering students can use up to 7 extension days on each assignment.
