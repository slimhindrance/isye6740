Answer from User 962232:
If your file is in a path like "C:/Users/gburdell/isye6740/hw1/data/data.mat" and your Python file or notebook is in a location like "C:/Users/gburdell/isye6740/hw1/hw1.py" you would refer to the file within a code using what is called a relative path that would look something like "./data/data.mat" where the "." is the location that you are actively in when running the Python code file (i.e. if you were to run the command "$ pwd" in that directory). So you would use that relative path in your code so that no matter where the code is ran, as long as there is a "data" folder in the same directory as the Python file, it will be able to be accessed.

  I'm using jupyter notebook meaning no file path necessary. So just reading "football.bmp" is fine, right?
