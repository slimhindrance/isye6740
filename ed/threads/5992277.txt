<document version="2.0"><paragraph>The 10 extension days are extremely generous and I am fine using those if there is no other option, but I wanted to ask this just in case. </paragraph><paragraph>I grew up in Malibu/Santa Monica (the area impacted by the fires) and have diagnosed PTSD from my home burning to the ground in a previous fire, other homes partially burning in other fires, and family/pets dying in fires. I have recently moved away from the area, but my friends/family are still there and most of them evacuated and a few lost their homes. I have been helping them coordinate housing/resources/medical care for some of the time instead of just focusing on school. This has also triggered my PTSD, which has made it hard to stay focused. I absolutely understand I was not directly impacted, and I made a choice to help them instead of working, but if you are offering any additional extension days it would be a appreciated. </paragraph></document>

Answer from User 134876:
Hi Lauren, first off I'm sorry for what your friends and family are going through, I'm sure it's a difficult time. This is something we handle on a case-by-case basis. Is there something specific you think you would need to help finish the assignment? How many days do you believe it would take?

In this situation, since you aren't the one being directly impacted, I believe it would be appropriate to offer up to 3 extension days without using your 10 day bank. Anything further, I think we should go through the dean of students office for an official solution.

  3 is great, thank you very much! If I need additional days I can take from the 10.
