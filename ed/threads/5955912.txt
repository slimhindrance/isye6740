Answer from User 300188:
For the future, can you please state exactly where things are at in the slides just to make it easy to find on our end?

To answer your question though, eigenvectors are orthonormal (or can be made orthonormal) when the matrix is symmetric (context matters here, because if the matrix isn't symmetric then that isn't the case)

In any case, eigenvectors from distinct eigenvalues from symmetric matrices are always orthogonal from each other. For example if you took the inner product of (1, 1, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 1 ,1) [the two eigenvector from that example), then you would get 0.

Notice though that these eigenvectors in that problem (1, 1, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 1, 1) can be written as 

( $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ , $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, 0, 0) and (0, 0, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$) which are the orthonormal eigenvectors (which you would probably get by default if you used any eigendecomposition package) 

Because multiplying an eigenvector by a constant is still a valid eigenvector. Notice in that particular example you're referencing that the constant $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ is pulled out. This is really just pulled out to show some relatively clean algebra.

In any case, you'll always get orthogonal eigenvectors from a symmetric matrix. One of many situations where you might prefer to make the eigenvectors orthonormal is when dealing with laplacians and spectral clustering because orthonormal eigenvectors might provide some numerical stability when doing calculations.

  Thanks for the detailed explanation, it’s very helpful. I’ll make sure to be more explicit next time.
