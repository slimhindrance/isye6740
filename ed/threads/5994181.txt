<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Does the whole code need to run at once for question 3? Is it ok to have different sections of code for different questions broken out into different cell blocks? Or does it need to be a python script where it all runs at once?</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 134876:
Your code for the image compression problem should run in entirety, generating all your results for every image and K value within the specified time limit.

You can separate out the run for L1/L2 distances, but your notebook still should run without any additional interaction from your grading TA.

  Comment from User 1133909:
  I can have it broken out into different cells though right? Just as long as it works all the way through when they hit "Run All" in the Jupyter Notebook?
