Answer from User 896413:
Sometimes Canvas will time out. Try refreshing your window. Otherwise, all lectures are available in the Media Gallery.



  Comment from User 1127985:
  Gotcha, thanks. 

FYI, still doesn't work. But your response made me try a different browser, which works.
My main browser is Mozilla, still access is denied after restarting computer and browser. Worked when I opened up the links via Chrome. I think there's some restrictions on multiple logins?
