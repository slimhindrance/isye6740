Hi, I am also having this problem. Honorlock is enabled and quiz is accessed in Chrome.

  I am having the same issue

Answer from User 134876:
I've reached out to our canvas IT to figure out what's going on here with the access code, but, since our course doesn't actively use honor lock if you are facing this issue you "should" be able to just click next on the canvas quiz page and skip over the honorlock quiz, going straight to the syllabus quiz.

I will update here when I hear back from canvas IT.

Update:
Our IT Guy says try it again now, it should be fixed.

  Thank you, Mark. 

It is working for me now. 

Appreciate the speedy resolution!
