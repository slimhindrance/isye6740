Thank you! Am I the only one that sees a weird format when clicking on it?

  Copy the text from the page the link goes to. Paste it into notepad and save as "filename.ipynb" . Then you can open it as a jupyter notebook.

We uploaded the notebook to the CDA website: 

https://github.gatech.edu/pages/ISYE6740/CDA-handbook/ta_handouts/homework_tips_python.html#eucledian-distance

This should make it easier to see the code and download. The website is a new process for our team this semester to share learning material from office hours.
