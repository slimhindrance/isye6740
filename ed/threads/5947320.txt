<document version="2.0"><paragraph>It was mentioned each student will be assigned a specific TA. May i know where to check that information ? How do we know which TA is assigned to us ? Thank you</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 134876:
TA's will be assigned after the drop period has settled down, starting next week. You will be able to check in canvas to see this, under the people tab.

This is only relevant for homework grading. You can attend any office hour that fits your schedule.
