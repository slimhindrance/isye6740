Without joining the group on Canvas, your project proposal/report will not be captured by the Canvas system, thus you will not receive a grade for your project. You will also be ineligible for participating in the peer review process.</paragraph><paragraph>Feel free to follow up on this ED post with any questions.</paragraph><paragraph>Note: Do not join other teams without discussing with those people first. A group must have consent from all members. If you see anyone in your group that should not be there, please send me an email and I will take care of it.</paragraph></document>
