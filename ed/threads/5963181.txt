<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hi TAs,</paragraph><paragraph>I understand that we have AI tools usage policy, but I'm still a bit unclear of how to reference/cite within the homework. I wrote my own code and a small portion is based on the demo code provided in the class. Citing the demo code in this case seems very straightforward. But I'm unsure of how to cite the example code that I learned and adapted from ChatGPT. My two main questions are:</paragraph><paragraph>1. Since we don't include code in the PDF report, should we still write reference to ChatGPT usage in the report or only in the code/programming file?</paragraph><paragraph>2. Would the following format of citing ChatGPT be acceptable? If not, what additional information do I need to include in the citation?<break/><break/>"This code was adapted from an example provided by ChatGPT. Original suggestion was modified to meet the specific requirements of the problem."</paragraph><paragraph>Thank you!</paragraph><paragraph/></document>

Answer from User 213547:
If you have referenced Chatgpt for the code, please provide reference of it in the code as a comment. Maybe a snippet of the chatgpt code that you used may also be provided in the comments section.

  Hi Neepa, I will change my code to remove the adapted portion from ChatGPT

Answer from User 134876:
If you utilize ChatGPT at all, We request that you attach a full breakdown of the prompts you used. Taking output from ChatGPT and directly using it within your code is strictly against the AI policy and will generate an OSI investigation for any assigments that we believe are LLM generated. Providing us the breakdown of the prompts you used and how you used them will help us understand whether what you have included in your report falls within acceptable usage or not.

I strongly recommend not using ChatGPT at all for your assignment, especially to generate sample code / assist with problems.

  Hi Mark, thank you for your response! I will take out the part that I referenced ChatGPT and rethink how I should revise my code accordingly.
