<document version="2.0"><paragraph>If I don't do the gradescope submission, I don't have to submit the gradescope scaffolding requirements, correct? I ask because I see that the output for the gradescope submission is very specific in requesting how outputs are formatted, however, I can format my outputs differently if I just submit through canvas?</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 672141:
That's correct, the submission to Gradescope has very specific requirements. For the code submission to Canvas, you can choose how you want to format/display the outputs.

Thanks, however, I am confused by the "img" output here in gradescope. Are you asking for our height*width? Or is this even required for the canvas submission if I choose to void gradescope?
