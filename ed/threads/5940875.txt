<document version="2.0"><paragraph>All of us on the CDA instruction team are excited to work with you, as you work through our material. That said, we know you will sometimes have questions or concerns. With that in mind, there are a few ways that we will communicate with you, and that you can communicate with us.<break/><break/><bold>Canvas:</bold><break/><break/>We will use Canvas to send announcements from the instruction team to all students, about topics like grade releases, office hour changes, and other important logistics. We will also provide feedback on your assignments within the submission pages on Canvas. <break/><break/>However, you should not, under any circumstances, try to contact the TAs on Canvas. Any message sent to us via Canvas will be ignored. We have seen students lose credit by ignoring this point on the syllabus, and it is always very sad. There are plenty of other ways to get in touch with us, such as…<break/><break/><bold>Office Hours:</bold><break/><break/>Every single TA, as well as Professor Xie, will hold 1 hour office hours sessions on Zoom each week. Our office hours sessions are set up so that students in any region can interact in person with at least one of the TAs or the Professor. Don’t feel like you have to attend a specific office hours session, choose whatever works best for you. You certainly don’t need to come to every office hours!<break/><break/>In office hours, feel free to ask us any questions you like, as long as they are not about personal topics, like your grade. Sometimes Professor Xie and the TAs plan particular topics for office hours, but often what happens with the time will be driven by you and your peers…please leverage this.<break/><break/>The office hour schedule can be found here (link TBA). If a TA needs to reschedule or cancel an office hours session, they will send an announcement on Canvas. Please leave up to 10 minutes at the start of a session for a TAs to arrive. We generally start on time, but in rare circumstances there can be technical difficulties. Likewise, TAs will wait 15 minutes after the start of an office hours session for students to attend. If no one shows up, then the office hours will conclude.<break/><break/>Office hour recordings will be posted to the Media Gallery, much like lectures.<break/><break/><bold>Email:</bold><break/><break/>Early in the course, you will be assigned to a specific TA, who will be responsible for grading/regrading your assignments, keeping track of extension requests, and addressing any personal questions you may have. We will not change these assignments after they are made, save for unique circumstances. Each of us has an email (you can find those on the syllabus), and you should email your TA at that email address if you need to get in touch with them. Trying to contact your TA in any other way (Canvas, here on Ed, etc) does not guarantee you a response.<break/><break/>If you have a concern about your particular TA, you should email the Head TA, Mark Patrick.<break/><break/><bold>Ed:</bold><break/><break/>Alongside office hours, you may feel free to ask the instruction team questions on Ed. A different TA will monitor Ed each day, so please leave up to 24 hours to receive a response (generally we’re much faster than that, though). Because a different TA monitors Ed each day, you should not try to contact any of us individually on Ed. This means that questions about topics like grading should never be asked on Ed, you should send such questions to your TA over email. However, if you have a question you’d prefer to only have the instruction team see, feel free to make a private post, visible to all the instructors.<break/><break/>Some other things to keep in mind about Ed…</paragraph><paragraph>- Before asking a question, do a bit of reading first! Often someone else has asked your question, and you may find your answer there. <break/>- We do not pre-grade homework. In particular, questions that look like ‘TAs, I have this plot, does it look right?’, will generally remain ignored by the instruction team. That said, you can share these sorts of results on Ed…just make sure you watermark them! If you don’t, the TAs will delete your plot from Ed.<break/>- We will not debug your code. Questions like ‘Here’s a blob of code, it’s not giving me good results, please help me fix it!’ will usually be ignored. If you find yourself in this position…you can ask such questions to the instruction team differently. For example, describe the steps you are trying to take, and outline any troubleshooting you have already performed. If you think you are facing a bug, try creating a minimum viable example.<break/>- Sometimes topics (like the homework threads we will post) will be made as megathreads on Ed. In these spaces, you will be able to mark questions resolved/unresolved. If you want to add onto a question that is resolved, or you are unsatisfied with the answer to your follow up thread, remember to mark the question unresolved. That way, Ed will show the instruction team that you still need help. <break/><break/><bold>OMSA Slack:</bold><break/><break/>While you should not treat this as an official CDA forum, there is a CDA channel on the OMSA slack (#isye6740_cda), which you may use to interact with fellow students. Your TAs will keep an eye on that space every so often, and may potentially comment there…but do not send us private Slack messages unless we say otherwise. Also keep an eye on what you post there…the admins of the OMSA slack have kindly given the CDA instruction team the power to delete anything that might violate the Honor Code.</paragraph></document>
