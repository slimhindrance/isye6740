<document version="2.0"><paragraph>It's totally alright to handwrite explanations for questions, right? I know latex and markdown is a thing but I just prefer handwriting. In the homework policies post it seems that handwriting is reserved specifically for derivations, but I'm wondering if that can be expanded. This goes for all homeworks too</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 217529:
Yes, it is acceptable to handwrite your homework submissions. Be aware that legibility is a serious concern, as unreadable work may not be awarded credit.

In the past this has been fine for many, while an issue for other students.

We suggest Latex and Markdown for derivations, but Word is also perfectly acceptable.
