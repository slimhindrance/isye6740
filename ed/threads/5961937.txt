Answer from User 896413:
Please use the appropriate pinned thread #13.

You must show your matrices including the steps to derive the graph Laplacian in your report. However, at that point you may derive by hand or use code to compute the eigendecomposition. For the code approach, if you get very very small eigenvalues, you may round those to zero.

  Comment from User 1519483:
  Hi Anna, this comment contradicts the response I got from Mark Patrick in thread #13. I asked the same question above and he responded with the following:

"You can use python to validate your calculations, but you should be showing your math in the report."

Can you confirm which is the case? 

Answer from User 134876:
I apologize for any confusion caused here. I meant you should be showing the math as in the graph laplacian and matrix steps, as Anna has laid out. My bad, you can indeed use python to do the actual eigen decomposition step.

  Comment from User 1230103:
  If we use Python to compute the eigendecomposition, do we need to copy and paste our Python code into the report? Or is it sufficient to just show the results (eigenvectors and eigenvalues)?
