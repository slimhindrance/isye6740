Answer from User 300188:
Could be wrong, but it looks like you're using demo code.Just to let you know that demo code isn't 1 to 1 with the homework necessarily. You can use it to build a foundation, but you'll have to modify it. This particular function in the demo code is written for grayscale images which you aren't working with. 

You can call on packages in Python to display images, and reshape them as well. 



  Comment from User 1512058:
  I think I found my issue.. I only needed to use c and labels instead of P. Since c was (k,3) already and the labels variable held the cluster information for each pixel, I was able to allocate each RGB value from c to each cluster.

The package I was able to find was plt.imshow() which is able to produce an image now! 

Thanks for your guidance with the above.
