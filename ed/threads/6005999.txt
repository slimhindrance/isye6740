Answer from User 215365:
You are correct that SVD wouldn't apply since eigendecomposition is $U\Lambda U^T$  (this is at the bottom of slide 19). Also $Cu=\lambda u$ is more of a definition of an eigenvector and eigenvalue. So there should be a way to show that there are two distinct expressions that are eigenvalue decompositions of the matrix $A$.
