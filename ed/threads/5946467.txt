Answer from User 134876:
The demo code is showing an example of the vectorization approach, which is highly recommended (almost required) to get efficient performing algorithms. Our TA Paresh will be hosting an office hour specifically on vectorization in the near future, but it's essentially taking linear algebra and applying it to code.

Paresh is hosting Office Hours on this topic Saturday at 4pm EST
