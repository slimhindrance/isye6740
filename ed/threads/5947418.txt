<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hi Instructors,<break/><break/>For all of our upcoming homeworks, can we first write our math derivations on a piece of paper -&gt; take a photo of it and upload into our PDF report?<break/><break/>I am not familiar on how to write latex for these math proofs and would prefer writing on a piece of paper first and taking it as an image to be attached in a report<break/><break/>Thanks team</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 134876:
As long as your handwriting is very neat and legible, Handwritten is okay. But there are also services i.e. Mathpix that can convert an image into latex which is very useful for this purpose.

Answer from User 896413:
Also, I recommend scanning the document instead of taking a photo. It adjusts the lighting and contrast to make it look like an actual document instead of a photo. You can do it on any device.

For what it's worth, Overleaf is quite useful in helping you to learn to write LaTeX by way of using its templates. I've found it to be indispensable when writing papers, be they reports, white papers, or academic research.

Further, having a framework can help you to organize and structure your document ahead of time, as well as using templates to automatically generate title pages and bibliographies.

  Agree with Chris! If anyone wants to learn, the LaTeX tutorial will be Monday, Jan 13. Also, feel free to drop into either of our office hours if you need assistance troubleshooting LaTeX and using Overleaf for the homework.
