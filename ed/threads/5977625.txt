Answer from User 672141:
From what I know different IDEs can have issues exporting a Jupyter Notebook into PDF. As a work around, you can export as HTML and print to pdf that HTML page. You can try accessing the NB directly via Anaconda and see if it resolves your issue. 

For report writing, I heavily suggest to consider using Overleaf (Latex), it gets easier as you get more practice to write the theorical questions. There is a tutorial in the Media Gallery by Anna, and a tutorial deck in the TA Office hours here.
