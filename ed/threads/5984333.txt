<document version="2.0"><paragraph>To confirm, if working in Jupyter Notebook, when submitting the report, we should export our notebook to a pdf which would include our markdown responses and our code. </paragraph><paragraph>Then, when submitting the code, we would simply just include our as-is .ipynb file and the rest of the data files in the zip?</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 300188:
Yes. A .pdf of the jupyter notebook with all the answers, graphs, images, etc. and a .zip file of the executable notebook and data is fine. 

  Comment from User 1497720:
  Is there a template for the notebook? Was it provided? 

Answer from User 1332989:
I can't seem to find a way to hide code block when exporting a jupyter notebook to pdf in vscode. Anyone have an ideas?
