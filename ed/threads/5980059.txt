Answer from User 896413:
Yes, we have a rubric for grading. As long as you follow the instructions carefully you should be fine. If you want to clarify anything including what the deliverables are for each question, you are welcome to ask on Ed post or in office hours.

Points are different per question. Your best bet will be watching Neepa's homework walkthrough, where she usually will provide an approximate range of acceptable results. We don't pre-grade homework, but we can let you know if you're on the right track. As stated on the syllabus, conclusions and interpretation of results are more important than raw code, so the point distribution also tends to reflect that.
