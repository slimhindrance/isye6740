<document version="2.0"><paragraph>1. I plan to submit my PDF via google doc (instead of latex). For the math intensive questions, I did them by hand and intend to paste them into the google doc. Is this fine for submission?</paragraph><paragraph>2. The ipynb file within the zip folder doesn't need to be named anything special, right?</paragraph><paragraph>3. For question 3 of HW1, I understand that one of the requirements for submission is that the extra photo should be 200x150. My photo (according to an online website) is 192x362. Is that fine?</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 134876:
Pasting into your google doc is fine. No naming requirements for the ipynb, just make it make sense.

For the file size, our main goal is to ensuire students don't try to game their algorithm by using an excessively small image. This file size is fine.
