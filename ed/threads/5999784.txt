Please contact the Dean of Students for assistance and we can work with them to figure out a solution for you.

  HI 



I have done that but also I am working on getting caught up and I hired a tutor to help me do this.  I am meeting with them tomorrow night and Thursday night.  I will be in touch with you and give you an update after tomorrow night.



Thank you

Annamaria
