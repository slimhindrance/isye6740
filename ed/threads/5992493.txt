Answer from User 896413:
Your code must run through all images and all iterations of $k$ with a single run. We cannot modify your code, so we cannot comment/uncomment lines to import different images or change your $k$ values.

  For Q3 can we submit 2x .py files ? One for euclidean and one for manhattan. 

Also for Q5 - can we submit 2x .py files? one for each part of the question?

  Hi!  

I’m curious about this because it wasn’t specified anywhere in the assignment or syllabus that I noticed (ie that our code needs to generate every output in a single run).  

I took a different approach and ran the function using different arguments and saved the outputs as image files, then attached them to my notebook. All of the outputs are included in the write up, but the code only generates one at a time.

It’s very unlikely that I’ll have an opportunity to go back and rework my assignment hours before it is due. Does this mean I won’t get credit for those problems? I spent a ton of time working this assignment so it seems a bit unfair to get this information at the 11th hour, instead of as a requirement in the original assignment itself. I would hate for all that hard work and effort to be wasted.

Many thanks!
