<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hi, I'm trying to tune my k to find the number of clusters to achieve a smaller mismatch rate for each cluster. However, even when I increase my k, there is always one cluster that has at least a 90% mismatch rate. Is this normal, or should I go back and look at my spectral clustering algorithm? Thank you!</paragraph></document>

Answer from User 213547:
Please look at your spectral clustering algoritnm
