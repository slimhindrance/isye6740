<document version="2.0"><paragraph>Hi, is there a way to see what our GT Username is?  I recently changed my last name in the GT system (from Snyder to Falconi) and I'm not sure if my GT Username would have stayed the same or changed.

Answer from User 896413:
You're showing up as hsnyder3 for me. Here's your directory entry.

I think either is fine; the GT username is used so we don't mix you up with other students because we get so many students with similar names (and sometimes even identical full names, like mine!).

  Perfect, I'll submit as hsnyder3. Thank you!
