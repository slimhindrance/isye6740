Answer from User 896413:
As long as we know which .py files are which, your file names are fine. If you'd like, you can include a readme file to explain the files and which ones to run.

  Hi Anna, may I ask what does readme txt file look like? I do have some package like sklearn, matplotlib, scipy are using. I'm not sure if these packages need read me and I don't know how to make this txt file. Thank you!
