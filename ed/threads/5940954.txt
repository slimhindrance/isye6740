Answer from User 1489130:
Hey Lauren,

I think we took DO together last semester. You helped me on Piazza in the last module on branching and bounding ;)

Anyways, I was already in the process of putting together a PST study group. I have two people confirmed at the moment, and I'm talking with 3-4 others about possibly joining. I don't have their bios, but if it's helpful, here's mine:

Time Zone: PST, I live in the California Bay Area

Communication: Discord, text, or email preferred

Experience: former high school math teacher.  I taught statistics and calculus, and I recently re-took a linear algebra and differential equations course before starting OMSA. I'm very comfortable with calculus and pretty comfortable with linear algebra and statistics. 

Skills: very, very similar to you: strong math background, midrange Python (did well in CSE 6040, and I have been using Python in personal projects for 2-3 years), solid at LaTeX (used it extensively in DO, iAM, and when I was teaching to make my own class materials), Jupyter, Desmos (love Desmos), great at writing/formatting and making everything look very nice, never used MATLAB before

Effort: full-time OMSA student. I plan to put a lot of effort into all the work I do, especially for a fundamental class like CDA. I've heard CDA is tough to do alone, so I'm really motivated to find others who can support each other.

Project Topic: Unsure at the moment.  I’m open to ideas!

Let me know if you're interested, we'd love to have another math person on board!


  Comment from User 1512035:
  I found a group, but if you're taking DVA next semester I'm definitely interested. Thank you for getting the Discord PST study group running. 

Answer from User 1521559:

Time Zone: PST, I live in California ( LA area)

Communication: Discord, text, or email preferred - aguseinova3@gatech.edu

Skills: comfortable with Math, statistics, Python

Effort: full-time OMSA student

Project Topic: we can decide when an entire team been formed

Let me know if you want to get connected any soon!

  Hi Lauren,

I'm Sadhana, working as a Senior Bioinformatician. This is my 4th semester and 5th course. I have experience with python (did well in CSE6040 and worked on a project in CSE6242) and used LaTex (in CSE6242). Good at math and MATLAB during my undergrad but haven't worked on it recently. I'm also interested in working on a project related to biomedical science or biology. Time zone : PST, I live in bay area, California. 

Best,

Sadhana

Answer from User 1512069:
Hi Lauren (and everyone else in the tread!), looking forward to the semester and would also be interested in forming a study group!

Time Zone: I live in Richmond, VA (EST) working remotely for team based in San Diego, CA.

Communication: Discord and text preferred but email is fine.

Experience: Former industrial engineer turned full-time data analyst, United States Postal Service (undergrad in ISE).

Skills: Strong Python and SQL (use both daily at work, did very well in 6040) comfortable with R as needed. Solid math background from undergrad and SIM but definitely had to grind some rust off when I started OMSA. This is my 6th class (IaM, 6040, MGT6203, SIM, REG)

Effort: Part time student, CDA is my only class this semester along with the 9 to 5. Really hoping to dig into the fundamentals and give it the attention it deserves.

Project Topic: Open to suggestions but would be interested in diving into routing/network optimization (Traveling Salesman, Vehicle Routing Problems, etc). I use them extensively at work but would like to do more work with the underlying theory and less piping data back and forth to API endpoints.

Cheers,

Malcolm 



  Comment from User 1127985:
  Hi Malcolm,

Is there room in your group? Although network and routing optimization isn't my forte, is it an interesting topic i'll like to dive into. 

Time Zone: Atlanta, GA (EST), work remotely in CA as well.

Communication: text and email (personal)

Experience: structural analyst, 2nd masters

Skills: matlab, python, latex, R (intermediate)

Effort: Part time student as well, CDA is my only course.

Project Topic: expertise is acoustics and dynamics loading but your topic is cool too.

Please let me know if you want to connect. My email is pnguyen363@gatech.edu

Answer from User 1323477:
Hey Lauren, nice to meet ya! I'm super interested in forming a study group.

Time Zone: I'm also PST. San Francisco, CA.

Communication: I'm up for any communication platform.

Experience: Completed my undergrad in data, dived straight into this program.

Skills: Relatively strong coding background in languages like Python, R, and SQL. Did well in 6040. I've completed several data-driven projects both in-class and for different firms. I have experience in implementing NLP and other machine learning models. Decent math and statistics background. Excited to do my best in this class!

Effort: Full-time student so I'll be putting my all into this class!

Project Topic: I'm flexible, though I already have a teammate and am more-so interested in the study group aspect.

Best,

Richard

  Comment from User 1127985:
  Hi Richard,

Is your group looking for a third or are you just looking for a study group? 
I am down for both. 

Answer from User 1230089:

Answer from User 1232296:
Time Zone: AEST, Sydney, Australia

Communication: Discord, WhatsApp, or email

Experience: 18 years Electrical Engineer

Classes taken: 6501 (A), 6414 (B), HDDA (A), 6040 (A), DO (A), 6203 (A)

Skills: Strong math background, proficient in Python, SQL and LaTeX.

Effort: I put a lot of effort into my assignments and projects, and I usually try to start as soon as possible so I can have enough time to refine my work. 

Project Topic: I'm open to suggestions, but lately my preferences have been heavily influenced by the topics covered in HDDA. Anything related to image and signal processing (including voice) would be of high interest to me. I have recently used some of the tools we learnt in HDDA for a personal project on classifying physical activity based on accelerometer and gyroscope data from mobile phones, you can have a look here https://github.com/amoughnieh/Human-Activity-Recognition. Using wavelets for feature extraction is something I'm looking to explore, their math is also interesting, we can write a ton about it. If these sort of topics are of interest to you please reach out 😀

Thanks again, I would love a discord invite!

Answer from User 1230001:
Hey Lauren,

I would love to join a potential study group if still available!

Time Zone: PST, I live in Portland, OR!

Communication: Any, discord/teams/text preferred

Experience/skills: My experience comes primarily from the classes that I have taken, I have a decent math background and did well in 6040, no current experience to matlab but would be open to learning. 

Classes Taken: All basic level courses, DAB, Regression, and Simulation; currently taking this course and HDDA.

Effort: I am currently working part-time (~20 hours/week) and can dedicate my free time outside of that to schoolwork and can usually work with others schedules.

Project Topic: I am up for anything but would be very interested in something potentially related to HDDA as it would be fun to relate the two courses I am taking, or something to do with biology/biopsychology, as that was my undergraduate background!



Thanks for reading, and I would love a discord invite if possible: Discord: whltney, email: wsnead6@gatech.edu!

Thank You!

Answer from User 134876:
This thread appears to have originally started as a request for study groups, which is why it was left up. It's now looking as if students may be confusingly using it as an additional project group thread, so I will lock this thread and direct students to use the primary #6 Finding a Project team thread.
