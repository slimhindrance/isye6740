Hey class,

Setting up this space to allow our TAs to introduce themselves.

We have a very diverse set of TAs this semester, each with their own experiences and perspectives to contribute to the course...so I think it would be good to let you know a bit about us/our backgrounds/what we're interested in.

Comment from User 284691:
Hi all! My name is Alex Nanni, and I'm an alumnus of the OMSA program and a current student in OMSCS. After finishing OMSA, I started working in institutional research at a university, where I use data analysis and visualization to facilitate data-informed decision making. 

Fun facts: I lived and worked in Thailand for 17 years; I moved back to the US, to my home state of Rhode Island, in June 2023. I have an academic background (master's and doctorate) in education. 

ISYE 6740 was one of the absolute best courses among the many excellent courses that I took in OMSA! I'm glad to have this opportunity to be part of the course community once again. I look forward to an excellent semester!
