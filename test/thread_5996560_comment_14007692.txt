Comment from User 898337:
Hi, "subject02-surprised.gif" file seems to be missing in the 'yalefaces' folder inside HW2 scaffolding. Was this intended? Otherwise, there's a mismatch of 11 subject 1 images to 10 subject 2 images.

  Comment from User 896413:
  That is correct, there are a total of 11 images for subject01 and 10 images for subject02. It is intentional.
