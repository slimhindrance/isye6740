Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q3 in this thread.

All demo code walkthroughs are on #10

Comment from User 814148:
For Q1.3, I'm not understanding how the demo code for the classification of ones and zeros is transferable to the RGB classification. I see that it's recommended we use the demo code to meet the expectations for the question solution. Some guidance on how to translate these two would be appreciated. Thanks.

  Instead of using distances between two numerical values for the grayscale of the pixel, try using the distances between two tuples each containing a vector of numerical values for the R, G, B pixels.
