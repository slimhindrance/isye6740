Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q4 in this thread.

For spectral clustering specifically you can use the sklearn kmeans package for the kmeans portion only, but you must implement the spectral clustering portion of the code yourselves. We allow this because the primary algorithm in this problem is spectral clustering, not kmeans. In general, when an algorithm is a smaller part of a larger algorithm, we allow package use for the smaller piece while you code the larger piece.

Comment from User 1230089:
did we need to calculated the weighted average of the overall mismatch rate? because i didn't see that statement in the homework.

  You do not need to calculate the weighted average of the overall mismatch rate.
