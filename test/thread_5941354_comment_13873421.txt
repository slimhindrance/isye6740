Comment from User 307048:
Hi! When I set my output variable to "class" I get a syntax error because the code is seeing it as trying to define a class rather than assigning a variable. If I submit to Gradescope, if I call the output variable a different name, will that break the grader? I assume submitting normally would be fine to change it to "class_vector" or something like that.

  you might want to wrap it as string "class"
