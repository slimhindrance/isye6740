Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 814148:
Would love some clear guidance on tuning epsilon for Q3. I understand that we want to keep epsilon reasonably low while preserving as many edges as possible for each node, but this doesn't seem as straight forward as looping through a range for epsilon while setting an minimum number of edges per node.

  Comment from User 672141:
  It can be as straight forward as you described, depending on your implementation. It's important first to have the ISOMAP algorithm working and plotting the embeddings, then working on the tuning. 

If you try to tune half way as you are working through the algorithm, you will encounter more issues and it will be more difficult to figure out if the root cause is the tuning or the implementation itself.

    Thanks Patricia. I just did exactly what I described and realized it can work lol. I did a somewhat manual tuning though by printing the results of each iteration and pinpointing where the change in total distance shrank but the minimum numbers of neighbors wasn't absurdly large. I ended up matching the ISOMAP plot from the slides with my selected e. Although its a mirror image of the plot I understand that's acceptable.

      Comment from User 672141:
      Yes, if the plot image is flipped, that's fine. Glad it worked out!
