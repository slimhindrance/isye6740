Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q3 in this thread.

All demo code walkthroughs are on #10

Comment from User 805441:
I have a basic question about the problem set up. 

The homework states that the output should be a column vector with size(pixels, 1) elements. Based on my understanding, this is not right. 

Shouldn't the dimension be size(pixels, 0)? (== # of pixels)

A quick reply would be helpful.

  Comment from User 213547:
  The dimension of the column vector will be  ( pixels, 1)

    Comment from User 805441:
    Thanks, but I don't believe so unless the pixels are transposed. 

It is strange, because my code runs and passed the gradescope with my understanding.
