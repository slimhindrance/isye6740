Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 1128222:
On several occasions now I've noticed that numpy isn't producing symmetric matrices when it should be (for instance, a product of three symmetric matrices C = (-1/2) H ((D)^2) H; all of the inputs were verified to be symmetric). In this case, can we just force the symmetry by replacing C with (C + C.T)/2? Here is a github link to the same issue (with np.dot instead of np.linalg.multi_dot): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12218

  Yes, that is permitted. You are aiming for results similar to the ISOMAP paper.
