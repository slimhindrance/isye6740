Comment from User 1229905:
I am trying to figure out how to implement the best epsilon function and I see that the paper defines epsilon as:

but I am having trouble understanding the definition, especially what  r_0. I haven't been able to find any additional information on tuning epsilon.

  Comment from User 497513:
  It seems to me the formula you cited is about the theoretical analysis and $r_0$ is the assumption about the underlying manifold the data is drawn from.

In our problem, we don't the knowledge about $r_0$. Estimating $r_0$ is very difficult.

In fact, you can choose your threshold with empirical exploration. One clue you can think of is that, 

1) find all pair-wise distance among all data points. 

2) sort the distances, when $\epsilon = 0$, it suggests all data points are isolated without neighbor, when $\epsilon \geq d_{max}$, it suggests all data points are connected, where $d_{max}$ is the largest distance.

3) you can explore the proper value in the range $0 \leq \epsilon \leq d_{max}$
