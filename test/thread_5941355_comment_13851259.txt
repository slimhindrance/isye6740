Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q4 in this thread.

For spectral clustering specifically you can use the sklearn kmeans package for the kmeans portion only, but you must implement the spectral clustering portion of the code yourselves. We allow this because the primary algorithm in this problem is spectral clustering, not kmeans. In general, when an algorithm is a smaller part of a larger algorithm, we allow package use for the smaller piece while you code the larger piece.

Comment from User 1133602:
Will SciKit Learn's kmeans then be added to the requirements.txt file for this problem in Gradescope?

  Comment from User 979414:
  It is already updated in gradescope. You can add it manually to your local file

    Thanks, Paresh!
