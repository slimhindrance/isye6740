Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q4 in this thread.

For spectral clustering specifically you can use the sklearn kmeans package for the kmeans portion only, but you must implement the spectral clustering portion of the code yourselves. We allow this because the primary algorithm in this problem is spectral clustering, not kmeans. In general, when an algorithm is a smaller part of a larger algorithm, we allow package use for the smaller piece while you code the larger piece.

Comment from User 1512040:
are we expected to treat this as a weighted graph? meaning, if there are duplicate edges in the dataset, should our adjacency matrix have values > 1?

  Comment from User 672141:
  Whether you treat it as a weighted or unweighted graph for this dataset, I don't think it will impact the results for this question (there may be one instance of a duplicate edge). You can choose either approach.
