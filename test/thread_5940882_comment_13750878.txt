Comment from User 1230089:
Hi, I was wondering if we could request a calculus bootcamp/ review? thanks in advance!

  Comment from User 134876:
  Generally this is considered a required pre-requisite for the course, and while we answer some basic questions throughout on these topics we usually point students towards the additional resources we've provided on canvas.

Our TA Alfie does hold a linear algebra review session, which is as of yet not yet scheduled. What specific topics of calculus do you feel that a review would help you on?

    Comment from User 1230089:
    I was wondering is Alfie's OH still on tomorrow? 

as for the calc review, i  couldn't think right off the bat what exactly i'd like a refresher on. I'll definitely get on of the TA sessions and ask for help when time comes instead. Thank you Mark

      Comment from User 134876:
