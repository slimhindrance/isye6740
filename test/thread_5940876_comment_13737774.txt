Hi All,

I'm west coast, out in Phoenix, AZ. Would be happy to join a team for the group project. This is my 4th semester and 4th class in OMSA. 

Don't know what else to put here, but happy to answer any questions or connect further here, via the various OMSA slacks, email, etc. Thanks!

  Hi Kyle,

I just replied to Albert Liu who posted recently and is also in PST. I noticed you may be as well so perhaps we can all 3 join up if you reply to his thread where I posted my info too? Thought I might reach out since your post may be a bit buried by now =)

    Hi Roberto,

Seems like one or two more people replied to Albert's thing above, but if you might need another person my GT email is kylerockoff@gatech.edu. I'm not sure of my plans yet (might depend on if I connect with people in a study group I'm attending later this week), but as of now still interested. Thanks for replying.
