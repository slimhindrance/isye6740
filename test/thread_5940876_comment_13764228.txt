  Hi Reese,

Iâ€™d love to team up with you! Machine learning for drone detection or other defense-related topics sounds like a fascinating area to explore. Iâ€™m a data scientist based in Arizona, with experience working on projects involving big data and machine learning. Iâ€™ve worked extensively with tools like Python, Spark, Databricks, and Azure Data Factory, applying advanced analytics to solve real-world problems.

This is my 8th course in the program, and Iâ€™m excited to contribute my skills to a meaningful project like this. Let me know how we can coordinate. Iâ€™m happy to connect via email, Slack, or any method that works best for you.

Looking forward to collaborating!

    Hey Kriti, 

It is NOT Nice to exactly copy-paste my profile description from CSE6242 class and deceive others. Incase your experience 100% resembles then still plz write in your own words.
