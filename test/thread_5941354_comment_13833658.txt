Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q3 in this thread.

All demo code walkthroughs are on #10

Comment from User 1512053:
Q3.1 - are we expected to include all 15 images in the PDF report or will the printed result in the notebook suffice?

  Comment from User 799310:
  Yes, you should include them in the report.

Per the Homework Policies: "Your homework report must contain all plots, images, analysis, and question answers in the PDF report. Anything present in code/files in your zip but not in your report will not receive points."
