Sorry i have a basic question, how come the third dimension of the turtle image is 4 ? Shouldnt it be 3 ? shall i just drop the fourth column ?

  Comment from User 1133602:
  Yes, for this image, you drop the last column.

  Comment from User 672141:
  Certain image formats have an additional channel besides the 3 channels for RGB. The 4th channel is the alpha channel for pixel transparency.
