Comment from User 318771:
Hello 

I am based in Atlanta, GA (EST timezone) and would be like to join a team. Ideally with the folks in EST or CST timezone.

This is my 8th course in OMSA, and I am a working professional for over a decade. I have expertise in Databricks, Python, PowerBI and various other data analytics tools/technologies. I have strong programing, management and communication skills and I can use help on math. 

I am open to any topic for the project. I am free during most of the evenings.

I can be reached at adarsh.gupta@gatech.edu

Thanks!

Adarsh
