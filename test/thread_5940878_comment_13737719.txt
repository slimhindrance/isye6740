Hey class,

Setting up this space to allow our TAs to introduce themselves.

We have a very diverse set of TAs this semester, each with their own experiences and perspectives to contribute to the course...so I think it would be good to let you know a bit about us/our backgrounds/what we're interested in.

Hello everyone,

My name is Brent Speelman and I graduated from OMSA in Fall 2022. I have a couple of degrees in chemistry, but my research involved dynamical systems (chaos theory) applied to epilepsy and computationally modeling cold viruses. Iâ€™m looking forward to being a TA again (this is my third year) and working with you this semester.

Fun fact: I was a policy debate coach for a speech and debate club that my sons were also in.

  omg! have you published any journals? I'd love to check them out!

    Here are links to the epilepsy paper abstract and the virus modeling paper.

      My group is interested in virology for our project. Do you have any recommendation asides CDC to look for datasets? TIA!

        This site, CDC Wonder, is part of the CDC, but it has aggregated many sources of data on one page.
