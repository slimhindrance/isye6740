Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q1 here.

For 1.6, if you are using an example, you may use a PCA package.

Comment from User 1512055:
I'm a little bit confused about exercise 3. I found two eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors, which give me the first eigenvalue decomposition. What about the second one? Can someone give me a hint about how to find it?

  Comment from User 300188:
  If I multiply an eigenvector by a scalar is it still a valid eigenvector for that particular eigenvalue?

    Comment from User 962052:
    Question on this is that the Eigendecomposition formula we are given is for 

$$U\wedge U^T$$

and at least from one example I worked through, when multiplying the eigenvectors by a scalar so their magnitude is greater than one, does the Eigen decomposition formula need to be written as the more general

$$U\wedge U^{-1}$$

in order to hold?

      Comment from User 300188:
      Yes! Do note that $U^{T} = U^{-1}$ in the orthonormal case.

        Comment from User 962052:
        Yes, I see that specified in the notes for when it's written with the transpose. Thank you!
