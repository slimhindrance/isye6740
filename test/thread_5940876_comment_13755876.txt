  Hi Michael,

I am interested in joining your project team! I am located in Atlanta Georgia so our time zones would align. This is my 7th course in the program and have taken all of the core, advanced core, and the regression analysis course. 

I am currently a senior data analyst for home depot and primarily work with supply chain data but do have an interest in the financial sector which is why I would love to team up with you. 

I am also taking the Machine learning for trading course this semester which I believe I would be able to apply some of that knowledge to our project ( if we decide to do a project in the financial industry)

I also currently work from home so my availability would be pretty open for the most part. Let me know if you would like to work together.

Thanks!
