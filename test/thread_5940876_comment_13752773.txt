  Hi Natesha! Our names are almost the same LOL! 

I'd love to join your team if you still need members. My time zone is EST as well. I completely agree with your idea to do a meaningful project topic, and I also would prefer not to do something related to medicine or sports (especially not sports haha). I'm really interested in social media and marketing (I also have a YouTube channel! :) so I think that our wants really align here.

I'm very comfortable with R, Excel, and Tableau and also have experience with Power BI, Python, and SQL. I'm a full-time student so my schedule is very flexible! My email is nhavanur6@gatech.edu feel free to reach out if you'd like to team up!

    Would love to work with you! Saw your name in an earlier discussion and thought it was me- but realized I didn't post a response yet. Lol

      HAHA I thought the same when I saw your post ðŸ¤£  

I'll go ahead and shoot over a message to you on Teams! I'm also okay with using Discord or a text group though

I'm also hoping to work with real data; a project about social media/marketing sounds fun! Overall, I'm looking for a collaborative group where we can learn from each other and make an amazing project. Discord, Teams, text, Slack are all good with me. My teams contact is cpowers37@gatech.edu. Let me know if you'd like to team up!
