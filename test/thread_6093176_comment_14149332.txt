Comment from User 1497720:
Why does the K function exist since it looks like the normal distribution notation N(xi,h^2) makes the (1/h)*K((xi-x)/h) term redundant? Can't we just write p(x) = 1/m sig_{i=1}^m N(xi,h) ?

  Comment from User 799310:
  I wouldn't necessarily call it redundant. You make a good point about the normal distribution notation, however keeping K the way it is emphasizes its general, nonparametric aspect and allows for different kernel choices beyond gaussian (although I believe this problem is just Gaussian)

    Comment from User 1497720:
    That makes sense, thanks.
