Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 1230185:
I'm still not clear on method for tuning epsilon. I tried few values small to large and outputs looked more like PCA for large values. For moderate value output plot looked exactly like in lecture slides. Can I run a loop over few likely different values of epsilon and looking at heatmap of A and output plot comment on what I feel is good epsilon. 

It's basically visually tuning epsilon. Is this approach acceptable?

  Think about what it means to tune epsilon, especially for the adjacency matrix. Here are some tips for tuning, including expected results so you can pick the appropriate epsilon:
