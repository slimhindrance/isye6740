  Hi Daniela

I am based in Atlanta, GA (EST timezone) and would be happy to join. Is a spot still open?

This is my 8th course in OMSA, and I have been a working professional for over decade. I have expertise in Databricks, Python, PowerBI and other data analytics tools/technologies.

I am open to any topic for the project, and normally I am free during the evenings. I do travel a lot for work but this should not get in the way for me to join the calls.

Let me know if I can join this team? I can be reached at adarsh.gupta@gatech.edu

Thanks!
