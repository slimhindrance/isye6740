Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

In question 1, I plotted the adjacency matrix with my chosen $\epsilon$. To finish answering the question, I'm also supposed to show some of the images on it. The thing is that I don't get exactly what needs to be done... 

Assuming that the value $A_{ij}$ is given by the euclidian distance between datapoints i and j (considering its < $\epsilon$), which image exactly I'm supposed to plot there?

  Comment from User 497513:
  You can simply display the weighted adjacency matrix as a image.

    Mark says you should display a few images.
