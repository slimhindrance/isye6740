Comment from User 1230189:
McCade Pearson here based out of SLC, UT. I am relatively flexible in terms of communication and time. My day-to-day job is statistical customer research for a convenience store with just under 1000 locations. I feel super super strong in R, my Python is good enough and then I have a variety of other skills. I have huge amount of personal project experience in the sports world. I am taking classes 7/8/9 but this class is probably a tad over 50% of my workload.
