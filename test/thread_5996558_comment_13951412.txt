Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 1324673:
Part 2 to mentions the "kernel bandwidth". Are we supposed to talk about our epsilon value here?

  Comment from User 300188:
  Will probably update the wording in future semesters to be more accurate, but yes -- talk about how you chose epsilon.
