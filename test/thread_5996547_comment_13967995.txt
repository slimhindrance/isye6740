Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q1 here.

For 1.6, if you are using an example, you may use a PCA package.

Comment from User 962052:
Why do we divide the covariance matrix by m and not m-1? I know the formula for sample covariance would divide by m-1, but just curious of the intuition here.

  Comment from User 979414:
  This is a great question. 

In the grand scheme of things, m is usually a sufficiently large number, hence dividing by m keeps the math / formula simpler.

    Comment from User 979414:
    I am assuming your question was in reference to sample covariance, where m is already sufficiently large.

for true covariance i.e when we calculate this on actual data divide by m is actually correct
