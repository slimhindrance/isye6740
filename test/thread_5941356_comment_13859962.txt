For 5.2 it says if the pixel values are above 128 they are assigned as '1'. 

However shouldn't [128,255] inclusive be 1 and [0,127] inclusive be 0 if we were to make this an even split? Is there a reason why we tilt the odds towards 0?

  Comment from User 134876:
  This was more just for simplicity in wording sake, and realistically won't have a material impact on the data, but you're correct in actuality it should be an exact inclusive split.

    Thanks for resolving this!
