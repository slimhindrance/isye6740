Question 1.6 

Can I use a tool like Python to solve for the eigenvalues once I've come up with the Laplacian matrix? Or do we need to do it manually by hand for full points? Thanks!

  Comment from User 134876:
  You can use python to validate your calculations, but you should be showing your math in the report.

    Thanks Mark, just to confirm, we need to manually resolve the 5x5 determinant calculation for the matrix of interest? I ask because the amount of effort to perform this calculation manually is higher when compared to other questions with the same points.

      Following because I also want to know.

      Neepa's office hour mentioned people have used Python to solve for the eigenvalues/vectors but I guess she didn't specify how to document that, so I am also confused now

      Comment from User 134876:
      Thank you for requesting clarification, I realize I wasnâ€™t clear enough here. For the eigen decomposition/ eigen values themselves you can either compute manually or use python. You still need to show your steps regarding your matrices and graph laplacian.
