Hey class,

Setting up this space to allow our TAs to introduce themselves.

We have a very diverse set of TAs this semester, each with their own experiences and perspectives to contribute to the course...so I think it would be good to let you know a bit about us/our backgrounds/what we're interested in.

Greetings,

I'm an OMSA student and this is my second semester as a TA. I took this class this past summer so learning the course content is still fresh in my mind. I work as a DevOps engineer in Charlottesville, Virginia. I have a strong background in software development, so feel free to reach out to me or come to my office hours with coding questions and error messages.

Fun fact: I collect and repair retro video game consoles and accessories.
