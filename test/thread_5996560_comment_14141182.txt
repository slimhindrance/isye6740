Comment from User 307048:
For the projection residuals, I'm getting values in the 100millions/low billions. Does that magnitude sound right or should I revisit my equation? For 4.2 the equation given, do you square everything after calculating test_image - (eigenface)(eigenface.T)(test_image) ?

  Comment from User 213547:
  We are interested in the relative numbers of S11, S12, S21, S22,. Magnitude in the range is acceptable.
