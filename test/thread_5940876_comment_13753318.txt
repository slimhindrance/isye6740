  Hi Tanisha! I'd love to join your team if you still need members. My time zone is EST so our time zones match! I'm very comfortable with R, Excel, and Tableau and also have experience with Power BI, Python, and SQL. I'm a full-time student so my schedule is very flexible! My email is nhavanur6@gatech.edu
