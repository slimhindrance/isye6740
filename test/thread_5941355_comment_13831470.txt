Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q4 in this thread.

For spectral clustering specifically you can use the sklearn kmeans package for the kmeans portion only, but you must implement the spectral clustering portion of the code yourselves. We allow this because the primary algorithm in this problem is spectral clustering, not kmeans. In general, when an algorithm is a smaller part of a larger algorithm, we allow package use for the smaller piece while you code the larger piece.

In the football demo code, after the function definitions, n and k are defined as specific integers (321 and 13 respectively). I understand there are 13 groups, but how does n get determined?

  Comment from User 799310:
  321 is the number of nodes. If you open up nodes.csv, you will see 321 of them.
