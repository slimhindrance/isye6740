Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q3 in this thread.

All demo code walkthroughs are on #10

Comment from User 307595:
Q5 tells us to normalize pixel values (divide by 255) prior to running kmeans; do we need to do that in Q3?

  Comment from User 215365:
  You do not need to change the pixel values for this question.
