Hi, I am getting slightly different results for my PCA when I rerun it for both the first part and second part of this question. Is this to be expected? I am standardizing my data when this perhaps isn't necessary, but am mostly using the demo code provided from class

Upon further investigation, it seems that the magnitude of the primary components is staying the same, but only the sign changes. for example (made up numbers) if my primary components for Switzerland were 1.0 and 0.5 for one iteration, they might be 1 and -0.5, of -1 and -0.5 the next.

  Yes. Multiplying an eigenvector by a scalar is still a valid eigenvector. So orientation doesn't matter as much -- just where the points are at in relation to each other.

    Thanks! distance between points stays the same, so seems like it is implemented correctly
