Hi everyone!

My name is Phi Nguyen, this will be my fourth course in the OMSA program, and excited to take this class.

I'm currently looking to form a group for the class project. My areas of interest include acoustics, dynamics, and engineering in general. I'm also open to hearing about other project topics that leverage your expertise!

A little bit about me:

I'm based in Atlanta, GA, so my timezone is EST.

I'm proficient in Matlab, Python, R, and Latex

My preferred methods of communication are personal email (will share after forming the group), text, Zoom, or Google Meet.

If you're interested in collaborating on a project related to these areas, please feel free to reach out to me at pnguyen363@gatech.edu.

Looking forward to meeting you all!

  Hello Phil, My name is Thushar Garipalli. I am interested in joining a team for the group project. If interested, provide me with your phone number and I will add it to whatever chat you use (GroupMe, WhatsApp, or regular Messages). Here is some info about me if you are interested:

I live in Atlanta, GA

I am certified in both Python and Tableau

I make sure myself and everyone is doing their fair share when it comes to projects

I am very through and a perfectionist/completionist and I also make sure the project is submitted (in case the group member is busy or computer crashes or forgot to do it)

I always make reminders on what/when to do things
