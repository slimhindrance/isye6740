Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q3 in this thread.

All demo code walkthroughs are on #10

Comment from User 1489130:
Q3's formatting instructions suggest a particular input/output signature.  Reading from the assignment:

class: cluster assignment of each data point in pixels.  The assignment should be 1, 2, 3, etc...The output should be a column vector with size(pixels, 1) elements.

centroid: location of k centroids...the output should be a matrix with K rows and 3 columns...

Will we penalized if my output doesn't follow these guidelines exactly?  I know it says the input/output signature is suggested, but I just want to confirm the following:

Can I used a 0 based index for the cluster assignments, i.e. instead of 1, 2, 3, ... use 0, 1, 2, ...

Does the class output have to be a 2-D column vector?  Could it instead be 1-D, such as size(pixels, )?

Can the location of my k centroids be the transpose of what's suggested, meaning it would have 3 rows and K columns?

  The suggestions in the assignment are only suggested structure. If you are using the code scaffolding provided for the gradescope bonus, it is required to match the inputs/outputs in the scaffolding.

    Thanks for clarifying!
