  Hi Ian,

Are you in Charlotte by any chance? I'm leaning towards doing the project solo but if I find someone in Charlotte, I'd be interested in teaming up.

    Hey Sean,

I'm located in Raleigh.

Unfortunately, I've teamed up with a couple of classmates already.

Thank you for your interest in teaming up.

All the best!
