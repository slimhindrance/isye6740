Hey class,

Setting up this space to allow our TAs to introduce themselves.

We have a very diverse set of TAs this semester, each with their own experiences and perspectives to contribute to the course...so I think it would be good to let you know a bit about us/our backgrounds/what we're interested in.

Hello Everyone,

My name is Paresh Agarwal. This is my second semester as a TA. I took this class Fall 2023. 

I work as Software Engineer at Google. I have a previous bachelors and masters in Computer Science. I am very passionate about problem solving and programming. I enjoy learning most algorithms by visualizations / toy examples to get a better understanding of the concepts. 

I am happy to share my perspective and approach during my office hours.

Fun Fact: During pandemic I got interested in woodworking and I built a full study, temple and guest bedroom furniture from scratch. 


Looking forward to seeing you all. Happy Learning !!
