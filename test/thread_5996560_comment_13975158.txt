Comment from User 1512062:
I would like to clarify about Q4.2 about test scores and Sij
1. We only need the top eigenfaces for Subject 1 and Subject 2? Meaning for each Subject1, we just take the first eigenface? If thats the case, does i=1 mean first Eigenface for Subject 1 and i=2 mean first Eigenface for Subject 2?
2. Do we need to center the test image when we are computing the projection residuals? I see https://edstem.org/us/courses/70719/discussion/5996560?comment=13958705 stating we need to center while doing projection residuals
-> To this, I tried finding in lecture notes but they dont mention on calculating projection residuals. Can anyone guide me on how we should center them please?

Thanks team

  1. That's correct

2. You need to center the test image w.r.t. the data mean of the current eigenface. Keep in mind, PCA provides a new set of coordinates centered at the corresponding data mean. Thus, all projection with PCA must be shifted accordingly.

3. The projection residual definition is provided in the hw description. Simply follow the formula as it is.

    Can I clarify if you're able to elaborate more wrt to point 2 on centering
- Say if we are calculating the residual scores of S21 for example (Top Eigenface for Subject 2, Subject 1 Test image). Does this mean we center Subject 1 Test image wrt to the mean of Subject 2 data matrix (All 9 images of Subject 2)? Or how does this work specifically?
