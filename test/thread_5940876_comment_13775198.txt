Experience: Statistical Analyst--Market Research. Undergraduate in Mathematics--Statistics

Classes taken: All five generals and simulation. Currently in Military Gaming and Regression along with this class. 

Skills: Strong math background, R, SQL, Python. Mostly R.

Effort: I love me a good late night coding session, I put in appropiate effort for the program.

Project Topic: I have a strong background in sports analytics and have access to numerous sets of data there. I am constantly working on personal projects in that realm and would love to continue with that work. I am super familiar with NBA and NFL data but have gotten into the hockey a lot as a mentor of mine recently bought an NHL team. I could probably do a project on my own, but would much rather have 1-2 smart people to talk things through with!
