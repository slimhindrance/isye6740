Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q3 in this thread.

All demo code walkthroughs are on #10

Comment from User 1271302:
Is it a concern if the number of iterations or runtime is too small or too fast? Will that be a grading consideration? The image quality at each k looks good to me, but I am not sure if I am approaching the problem correctly. Thanks.

  Comment from User 134876:
  A properly vectorized approach can run very efficiently, so this isn't immediately a concern unless your iterations are like 2. As long as your final images are looking good, I would say this is alright.
