Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q4 in this thread.

For spectral clustering specifically you can use the sklearn kmeans package for the kmeans portion only, but you must implement the spectral clustering portion of the code yourselves. We allow this because the primary algorithm in this problem is spectral clustering, not kmeans. In general, when an algorithm is a smaller part of a larger algorithm, we allow package use for the smaller piece while you code the larger piece.

Comment from User 1230146:
Do we need to manually calculate eigenvectors/ values or can we use a package for that? This is for the first part of the question

  Comment from User 979414:
  you can use np.linalg for calculating the eigen vectors / values.
