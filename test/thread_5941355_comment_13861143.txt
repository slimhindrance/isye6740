Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q4 in this thread.

For spectral clustering specifically you can use the sklearn kmeans package for the kmeans portion only, but you must implement the spectral clustering portion of the code yourselves. We allow this because the primary algorithm in this problem is spectral clustering, not kmeans. In general, when an algorithm is a smaller part of a larger algorithm, we allow package use for the smaller piece while you code the larger piece.

I am getting a very high value for the number of cluster needed to achieve a small mismatch rate. Am I on the right track? Thank you.

  Comment from User 300188:
  I mean it's possible. Your best k shouldn't be so high though that it's almost the the number of points in the dataset.

    Got it,thanks.
