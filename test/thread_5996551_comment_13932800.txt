Comment from User 1512055:
I'm having some trouble to understand exactly how to implement the algorithm. For what I understood from the lecture, the covariance matrix is equivalent to $\frac{1}{m}X X^T$, where $X = [x^1 - \mu, ..., x^m - \mu]$, and by applying the SVD on it we conclude that the eigenvectors of $C$ will be the left singular vectors of $X$ and the eigenvalues will be the squared singular values obtained by the decomposition. With that, we have enough information to perform PCA.

However, in the slide 28 (lecture 4) we have:

"Eigenvectors of 𝐶 corresponds to left singular vectors of 𝑋
Find the weight vectors {𝑤 ! , 𝑤 " , ⋯ , 𝑤 1 } as the 𝑟 left singular vectors
of the data matrix 𝑋 (𝑟 is the number of principle components)"

With that in mind, I'm confused. Should I perform the SVD on $X$ itself or on $\frac{1}{m}X X^T$?

  Comment from User 672141:
  Eigendecomposition and SVD are two different ways to perform PCA on the data. For the purposes of this question, you will perform eigendecomposition using the covariance matrix C. 

About SVD, the slide mentions the input to be X but through derivation you can connect it to C= $\frac{1}{m}XX^T$ .

That helped! Just read the slides and my notes again and it's clear now. Thanks :)
