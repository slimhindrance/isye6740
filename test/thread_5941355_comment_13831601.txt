Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q4 in this thread.

For spectral clustering specifically you can use the sklearn kmeans package for the kmeans portion only, but you must implement the spectral clustering portion of the code yourselves. We allow this because the primary algorithm in this problem is spectral clustering, not kmeans. In general, when an algorithm is a smaller part of a larger algorithm, we allow package use for the smaller piece while you code the larger piece.

Comment from User 307595:
Seeing opposing answers from Neepa and Paresh below regarding ignoring empty clusters.  Can we get clarification?

  Comment from User 213547:
  You will get the same weighted average whether you ignore or do not ignore the empty clusters. Hence both our answers are correct.
