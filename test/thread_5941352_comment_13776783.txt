Comment from User 652074:
Hello, 

I have questions about HW1. I saw we can submit the HW by Assignments and Gradesscope. For questions 3,4,5, if we submit by gradescope, do we still need to resubmit by assgiment as well?

  Comment from User 300188:
  Yes. Per #34 , you submit to both Canvas and Gradescope.

    Comment from User 652074:
    For the pdf document we need to submit for HW1, do we need to list question and answer it under each questions?

      Comment from User 300188:
      You don't have to retype the question, but you need to indicate which question you're answering in the report.

    Comment from User 307528:
    Submitting to Gradescope is optional, correct?
