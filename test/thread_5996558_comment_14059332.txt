PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 1325815:
Can any MATLAB users assist on making this plot as shown by Professor Xie in the lecture with the images near their respective points?

  Comment from User 284691:
  You'd probably have to loop over something like the code shown here: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/311205-how-to-add-images-to-data-points

I used MATLAB for the homework assignments when I took this course, but I didn't add the images directly to the plot. I numbered the points on the plot and added the numbered images near the plot.

    Appreciate it, thanks! I scoured the Matlab Answers site for awhile and this is one of the more useful links for this problem on there. 

I may just end up doing something like you're saying with the numbers...but if I have enough time, that plot with the images on it is very nice!

      Comment from User 284691:
      Absolutely! It's great to learn new methods. If you have time, creating the plot with images is an excellent idea.
