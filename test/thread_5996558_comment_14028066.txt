Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 1230103:
Just want to confirm for Q3.3, we donâ€™t have to use the PCA code we wrote for Q2, right? We can use the PCA package from sklearn? Thanks!

  Comment from User 799310:
  Yes, you can use PCA package for 3.3
