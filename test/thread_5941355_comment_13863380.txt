Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q4 in this thread.

For spectral clustering specifically you can use the sklearn kmeans package for the kmeans portion only, but you must implement the spectral clustering portion of the code yourselves. We allow this because the primary algorithm in this problem is spectral clustering, not kmeans. In general, when an algorithm is a smaller part of a larger algorithm, we allow package use for the smaller piece while you code the larger piece.

Comment from User 1230089:
for 4.2, are we supposed to do eigengap heuristic or something like that? or just select the lowest mismatch rate based on 4.1's output?

  Comment from User 799310:
  It's asking for you to tune your k based off the mismatch rate, so consider what would be the best way to do that. Keep in mind you must also explain your thought process and discuss what your answer says about the network community structure
