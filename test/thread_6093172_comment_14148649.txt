Please ask questions related to HW3 Q1 here.

Comment from User 1498558:
for part (4) of this question, can we begin the derivation from the expectation f(\theta) provided in the lecture? or are we expevted to also write the full derivation for f(\theta)?

  Comment from User 215365:
  The first points of Slide 16 of the Density Estimation lecture (Module 3 in Canvas) outlines the beginning of this type of derivation. Slide 16 outlines the approach with samples, $x^i$ being real numbers, whereas with the homework question, $x^i$ represents samples that are vectors (n-dimensional observations). It would be good to show substantial detail for the derivation, as the question notes:

Please show the work for your derivations in full detail.
