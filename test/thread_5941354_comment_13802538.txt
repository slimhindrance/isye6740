Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q3 in this thread.

All demo code walkthroughs are on #10

Comment from User 307528:
Hello TAs - I am running my codes on Spyder (Anaconda). I am getting below output and error messages. Can you guide me what mistake I am making again and again? Next question - for Analyzing Manhattan distance, do I need to do all 3 images, or just 1 is good enough to complete HQ1Q3? Do we need to resize the football.bmp image into 400x225?

  Comment from User 979414:
  Now adjust your k-means implementation to use the Manhattan distance (â„“1 norm) metric. Please provide all of the same above deliverables for only the football.bmp image.

This is very clearly mentioned in the homework question. 


- There should not be any resize of image needed. For sea turtle you can ignore the 4th channel though.

    Comment from User 979414:
    from the error It looks like your code is having some dimension mismatch issues.

  Comment from User 962196:
  I ran into this as well. It looks like the sea turtle image is coded as RGBA. So it's a 225x400x4 image instead of a 225x400x3. The 4th dimension is the transparency, which is 255 for the entire thing. You should be able to safely remove that 4th dimension to get a 225x400x3 image.
