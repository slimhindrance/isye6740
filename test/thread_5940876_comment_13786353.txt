Hey everyone!

My name is Marco Vittozzi and I am looking for a project team. I live in NY (EST timezone) and this will be my sixth course in the program (previously taken CSE 6040, ISYE 6501, MGT 8803, MGT 6203, and ISYE 6644). 

I have an undergrad degree in Industrial Engineering and I am focusing on the program full time. I am open to any form of communication, preferably whatsapp or discord. I am skilled in python, R, excel, and I have a working knowledge of SQL. I am open to any project topic, but my preference would be in sports, finance, the stock market, or supply chain. 

My email is mvittozzi3@gatech.edu

Looking forward to a great semester!

  Hi Marco,

My name is Jocelyn and I would love to join your team working on your suggested topics. I live in Toronto (EST timezone) and this is my second course in the program (previously taken CSE6040)

I did statistical science in undergrad and have an msc in Biostatistics. I am currently working as a biostatistician in a pharma company. I do work full time but am only taking one course this semester. I am very responsive and responsible when it comes to group projects. Open to any form of communication as well and will be available after 4:30pm mostly everyday on weekdays and would be available on the weekends. I am skilled in python, R and SAS programming.

I will also send an email regarding this request. Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you!
