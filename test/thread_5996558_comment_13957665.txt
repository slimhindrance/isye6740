Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 1229905:
Are there any limitations on the packages we can use to calculate the adjacency matrix?

  Comment from User 300188:
  No, not really for the base assignment. Just don't call an isomap package.
