Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q1 here.

For 1.6, if you are using an example, you may use a PCA package.

Comment from User 1512061:
Hi, I just wanted to double check for 1.1, are the proof steps from Lecture 4 Slides 17-19 (starting with title "Solving the PCA problem")? 

And for 1.6, does this require a mathematical explanation or can we just explain conceptually?

  Comment from User 497513:
  1. you can use any lecture material you find approperiate.

2. Yes.

    Comment from User 1512061:
    For the second point, do you mean that either suffice?

      Comment from User 896413:
      Either is fine. You can use code to show an example, prove it using math, or explain it conceptually.
