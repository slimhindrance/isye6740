Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 1229972:
My understanding is that if we choose a large enough epsilon to connect every point in the dataset, our nearest distance matrix effectively captures euclidean rather than geodesic distance, and the rest of the algorithm essentially performs PCA. When I do this for the faces dataset and compared with sklearn's PCA the results are identical. Does this mean for the PCA implementation in Q3.3 I can simply call my custom isomap function with epsilon = np.inf? I only ask because it seems sklearn is not in the requirements.txt and I dont want to fail the Gradescope autograder because of this dependency.

  Comment from User 979414:
  sklearn is added to requirements.txt file on gradescope.
