Comment from User 1230051:
Do we get points off if our k-means algorithm converges early? For example, I set my max iterations at a certain number but it converges early at k=24.

  Comment from User 672141:
  The k-means algorithm should converge on its own and shouldn't need to reach a max iteration number. Points will be taken off if the stopping criteria is max iterations. Consider instead setting a threshold where the centroids are barely changing as a stopping criteria for convergence (an example of this is shown in the demo code).

    Got it ok thanks for that info! I think I managed to do that now. Is there a max iterations that our algorithm should converge under?  I'm getting over 200 iterations for k=48 and I'm not sure if that's too high.

      Comment from User 672141:
      You can increase the value of your threshold to reduce iterations. Depending on the image size, I think over 200 iterations is not unusual, it's more important to focus the runtime remains small.

        Understood thanks for the insight Patricia! Very helpful
