Q3.1

Should the "image" attribute of the map output in pixels or it needs to be a file path?

  Comment from User 979414:
  I am assuming you mean *img* attribute on scaffolding code. It would be the image pixels of shape (l, b, 3) in range (0-255)

    Comment from User 121859:
    Thanks! yes I meant "img".
