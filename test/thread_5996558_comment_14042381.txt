Comment from User 1519483:
For 3.1, so far I've visualized the adjacency matrix, but not sure what you mean by "illustrating images corresponds to nodes at different parts of the graph". Are you asking us to choose some nodes at random and show what their corresponding image looks like?

  A post by Anna explains this well.

  Sorry about the permission issue. Yes, you should just choose some random nodes and show the images. The images (three is fine) can go on the diagonal of a heat map, or somewhere on a graph visualization.
