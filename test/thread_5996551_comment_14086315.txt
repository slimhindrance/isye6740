Comment from User 307048:
What shape is the leaf.mat data in when you first ingest it? I can't open the file so just making sure I'm projecting the right direction using the demo code. Are the 16 leaf attributes the rows or columns in the demo code?

leaf = spio.loadmat('leaf.mat',squeeze_me=True)['M']

# extract attributes from raw data
Anew = leaf[:,2:17]
m,n = Anew.shape

Just trying to double check where I should/shouldn't transpose. Thanks!

  Looks like you are doing it correctly. There should be 16 leaf features as columns (which you will reduce using PCA).
