During this course, you will be responsible for delivering a research style final project report. This will involve a Project Proposal, The Final Project itself, and professional peer reviews on both.

All official guidelines are posted on canvas, feel free to use this space to ask administrative questions related to the project.



Some initial notes below:

1. All students, whether completing the project individually or as part of a team (up to 3 students) must join a project group on canvas. This can be done by going to the left-hand navigation bar and clicking people -> Term Project Groups then selecting an empty team to join. Be sure to join the same team as your group mates should you be doing the project together with other students. See #29 for more details.

2. For project submission, only the report itself is required. Code and data do not need to be submitted for the final project.

Do we any existing guidelines for project proposals talke about what should be included in the content? If so, could you kindly point me to the related page?

Additionally, would it be possible to provide a sample proposal as a reference? This would be incredibly helpful when we prepare for our proposal.

Thanks a lot in advance!

  For your first question, look at the document titled "Peer Review Expectations And Project Rubrics" on Canvas. As long as you follow the information in there about the proposal you're fine. There are no sample proposals, but you can look at one of templates provided in Canvas and use that if you want.
