Hi Class,

Please read the following instructions carefully and follow the steps for your project team registration.

Joining a group on Canvas

To Register your team, Please go to Canvas -> People -> Term Project Groups, and join an open group 'Term Project XXX'. If you are solo, Join a group by yourself, and if you're on a team join the same group as your teammates. This step is REQUIRED.

Please complete your team registration at your earliest convenience. Without joining the group on Canvas, your project proposal/report will not be captured by the Canvas system, thus you will not receive a grade for your project. You will also be ineligible for participating in the peer review process.

Feel free to follow up on this ED post with any questions.

Note: Do not join other teams without discussing with those people first. A group must have consent from all members. If you see anyone in your group that should not be there, please send me an email and I will take care of it.
