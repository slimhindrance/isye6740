There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 896256:
I'm stuck on the first step of forming the adjacency matrix. The number of rows is 698 and each row has 4096 columns representing the luminosity map of each image. The matrix I want to create as a first step is based on:

So I understand I will have a matrix that is 698x698. But if each point has 4096 columns how do I calculate the distance between them? Is this where the suggested shortest_path function comes in? I've tried to infer from the lecture but something is not sinking in.

  Comment from User 497513:
  Each element in $A$ is the L2 norm of two images. Taking L2 norm of two vectors gives you a scalar. Therefore, you should have 698x698 scalars.
