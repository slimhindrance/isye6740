Comment from User 814148:
I'm hitting this error while extracting HW2 zip file. It seems to be in relation to the naming convention used for the images. What's the recommended workaround? I can't rename the files before extraction, and the image files won't extract because the paths aren't writable. I haven't seen anyone else mention this issue which is surprising.

  Is it possible you are downloading this to a subfolder which has a long path already ?
Can you try downloading / extracting to your downloads folder ?

    Brilliant! Thanks Paresh.
