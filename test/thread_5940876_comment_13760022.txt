Hi everyone! My name is Ashleigh and I live in EST. I am living in atlanta on campus for the semester and am available anytime besides weekdays from 3:30-7:00 pm because I run on the track team here at tech! I have worked as a data science intern for a sports analytics company and will be moving into the CPG industry as a data science intern for Kroger. I have always been someone to pull my weight and then some in group projects so would love to find some people will the same mindset.

  Hello Ashleigh and Rinaldi, 

My name is Marco Vittozzi and I was wondering if you had another spot in your group! 
I live in NY (EST timezone) and this will be my sixth course in the program (previously taken CSE 6040, ISYE 6501, MGT 8803, MGT 6203, and ISYE 6644). 

I have an undergrad degree in Industrial Engineering and I am focusing on the program full time. I am open to any form of communication, preferably whatsapp or discord. I am skilled in python, R, excel, and I have a working knowledge of SQL. I am open to any project topic, but my preference would be in sports, finance, the stock market, or supply chain. 

My email is mvittozzi3@gatech.edu

Looking forward to a great semester!
