Hi, I’m Harsha, and this is my 9th course in the OMSA program. I might be a bit late to join the game, but if you’re still looking for a teammate for your project, please let me know. My interests lie in e-commerce and marketing, so I’m hoping to join a team with similar focus areas. I’m based in Seattle (PDT) and proficient in SQL, Python, Spark, R, and BI tools. Additionally, I have experience leading data science projects.
