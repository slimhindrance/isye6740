Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q1 here.

For 1.6, if you are using an example, you may use a PCA package.

Comment from User 307048:
For question 1.2, is it not enough to state that the eigenvectors of covariance matrix C correspond to each principal component? Or is there some other derivation I'm missing? In the lecture it just discusses how the second, third, etc. eigenvectors correspond to the second, third, etc. largest eigenvalues.

  Comment from User 300188:
  What does that process look like iteratively? Try to show that. What problem are you solving exactly to find the second and third principal components respectively and what does it look like?
