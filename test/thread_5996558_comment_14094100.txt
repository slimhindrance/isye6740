Hi, 

I am having a bit of trouble replicating the plots from lecture for question 3 of HW2. I believe it may be due to how I am reading in the data. When I read in the data, the information is strictly 0s and 1s and results in the following example image:

Can you please advise how I might be able to reconcile this? I am currently reading in the .dat file in Python and converting to "uint8". Thanks!

  Comment from User 962232:
  The data should not be 0 or 1. The pixel data is a float indicating the grayscale value for that pixel. Instead of casting to uint8 you should use float.

  Comment from User 1489130:
  Alternatively, you can multiply the floats Evan mentioned (values between 0 and 1) by 255, which essentially converts them to grayscale (0 to 255).  Afterwards, converting to uint8 and plotting should work.
