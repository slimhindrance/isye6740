Hey class,

Setting up this space to allow our TAs to introduce themselves.

We have a very diverse set of TAs this semester, each with their own experiences and perspectives to contribute to the course...so I think it would be good to let you know a bit about us/our backgrounds/what we're interested in.

Comment from User 799310:
Hi everyone! I graduated from OMSA in December 2023 and am excited to be a TA for the course this semester. I work as an AI consultant / developer in Washington, DC where I help develop AI applications for the federal government. I've also got experience in data science, machine learning, and software engineering. I've served as a TA at Georgia Tech since January 2023.



My fun fact is that I ran 2 marathons last year
