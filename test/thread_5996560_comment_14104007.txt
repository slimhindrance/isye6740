I am confused about how we are calculating Sij in 4.2. When I try and follow the formula listed in the question, I get a (61, 80) matrix, but the question indicates that we should get a single-number score for reporting. Thank you so much for your help!

  If your image is (61, 80) you will first want to deconstruct that into a (1x4880) vector and then find the squared L2 norm of that vector to be your Sij.
