Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 1512062:
For 3.2, as part of tuning the epsilon, I noticed this portion on residual variance of Isomap. My idea is to find the residual variance for each epsilon (subject to max epsilon boundary mentioned in https://edstem.org/us/courses/70719/discussion/5996558?comment=13983996 and get the best epsilon with lowest residual variance.

Now, I got a few questions here:
1. Is Dy the euclidean distance matrix obtained from step 1 of the ISOMAP algorithm but not subjected to the epsilon limits? I'm not quite sure what they mean by "Matrix of euclidean distance in low-dimensional embedding recovered by algorithm"

2. What is Dm here and how is it different from Dy? I see https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/91125/comparing-isomap-residual-variance-to-pca-explained-variance stating that Dm is the "euclidean distance matrix for PCA and the geodesic distance matrix for Isomap". Is this correct? If this is correct, then I want to ask
- What is the matrix we get from PCA to find this euclidean distance matrix? Is this the eigenvectors, or eigenvalues, etc?
- How about the geodesic distance matrix for isomap? Is this the "pairwise shortest distance matrix"?

Just trying to visualise what Dm and Dy this so I can implement the code logic in Python. Thanks team!

  1. $D_y$  seems to represent a matrix of distances after the algorithm has embedded the points (after the MDS step for ISOMAP). We don't really measure these distances with the homework question, although they should be similar to the values in the pairwise shortest distance matrix, $D$ (slide 7 of the Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction lecture). This is the goal of MDS, to preserve the distances as the manifold is unfolded and flattened.

2. I believe $D_m$ is the pairwise shortest distance matrix since it is ISOMAP's estimate of the manifold distances using the graph edge distances (weights). $D_y$ is different and can change depending on how many dimensions you choose to use for embedding (we use two dimensions for this homework question).

For PCA, $D_y$ would just measure the distance between data points ($z^i$) after embedding them (we also do not do this with this homework question)

Figure 2 in the paper shows this residual variance for embedding into different dimensions (between 1 and 10) and this is the context of Note 42. that is highlighted. 

This is an interesting idea for tuning.
