Comment from User 1133909:
I cant seem to get the residual values to classify correctly. The subject 1 eigenspace has lower values for both of the test pictures than the subject 2 eigenspace. Im not sure what i am missing here.

  Comment from User 799310:
  It's hard to say for sure just based on the description, but I would recommend checking that your preprocessing steps are consistent and also to verify any eigenface/residual calculations
