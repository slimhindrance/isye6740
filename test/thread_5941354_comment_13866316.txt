All demo code walkthroughs are on #10

Comment from User 1080381:
Hello - just wanted to clarify if the deliverables of questions 3.1 & 3.2 should be included in the PDF write up or as separate files in the zip file submission?

  Comment from User 672141:
  For 3.1 and 3.2, all reconstructed images should be included as part of the PDF report as well as time to convergence and number of iterations. If the images are not included in the report and you write instead "refer to code" or "refer to folder", this will lead to point deductions.
