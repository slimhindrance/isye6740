Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 814300:
In this question and in Q2 I am having trouble with the randomness of my answers. When I rerun the script, sometimes my generated plot will flip directions. After troubleshooting, it is because scipy's eigs() function returns the eigenvectors with opposite signs randomly. I tried setting a seed with np.random.seed(6740) which does not work. Reading scipy's documentation for the function, I see a vague statement about setting the initial vector Vo to control randomness, but I am wary of trying that. I noticed in the demo code where this function is used the results seem to be consistent but am unsure why that is.

  In this question, you don't need to worry about the flip. It is because the non-uniqueness of the eigenvector.

$$Au = \lambda u, \quad \quad A(-u) = \lambda (-u)$$

both $u$ and $-u$ satisfy the eigenfunction.

    Hi, can this non-uniqueness cause flipping for eigenvector 2, as well? I'm occasionally seeing negative values for eigenvector 1 or for 2 sometimes.
