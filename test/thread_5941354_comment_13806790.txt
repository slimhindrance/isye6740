Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q3 in this thread.

All demo code walkthroughs are on #10

Comment from User 814300:
If I use a reference from Stack Overflow for some minor portion in my code, do I need to cite it in the PDF or is a comment in the code with the URL sufficient?

For example, I looked up someone converting a np array to a PIL image

  Comment from User 979414:
  A comment in code should be sufficient.
