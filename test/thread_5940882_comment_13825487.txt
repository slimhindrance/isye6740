Comment from User 896430:
Videos from TAs' office hours are really helpful to us!

Could we standardize the filenames for all Teaching Assistants (TAs) in the Media Gallery? Including the date and a brief note in the filename could let us to follow the videos much easier. For example:

TA_OH_25_0113_Anna_LaTeX_Tutorial.*

TA_OH_25_0***_TAName_Vectorization_for_Implementing_ML_Models.*

Thanks!

  I'll bring up this suggestion with the TAs. For now, we've removed the accidentally started office hours (those that lasted only a few seconds) from the media gallery. This should hopefully make it easier to navigate

  Comment from User 134876:
  Unfortunately, Unless we schedule office hours 1 by 1, Zoom has an automatic naming convention that assigns the recording name for every scheduled session.

We do plan to link directly to the sessions that target specific topics in this post to more easily find them.

    Comment from User 1232277:
    I second @Yuesong Wang comment. It is very painful to navigate the media galley and know which video talks about what topics/hws. A general categorization or sorting/labeling would be very much appreciated and would save a lot of time!
