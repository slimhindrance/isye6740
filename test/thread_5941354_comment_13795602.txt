Q3.1
I noticed the load_image() function provided in the scaffold code can return transparence in addition to the RGB. The formatting instructions say: "For image dataset, it contains 3 columns". Should we ignore the transparence? if yes, would you be able to confirm if transparence is the first or the last element of the array?

In the Paresh OH, they mention that we can/sould treat the pixels param as (a,b,c) instead of (a,b,3) as in the code sample. But thats goes a little different from the exercise.

  Yes please ignore the alpha layer/transparency column. It should be the last element in the array as the first 3 should be the R, G, B values.
