Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 962326:
The plot I get is upside down compared to the ones in the slides. The data I worked on I got from isomap.mat and loaded the values from 'images' which is 4096x698. So, I did a Transapose to get 698x4096. Can you please tell me if this is correct or wrong?

  The orientation of the plot doesn't matter since the distances between the points will remain the same. You don't need to transpose the plot, you can leave it as it was.

  The .mat file ends up with sideways images because Matlab reads arrays differently than Python. Still works though. You could try the .dat file instead or flip images for the plot if it bothers you.

  Some students have had luck using order = 'F' or 'C' in their reshape (depending on how you read in your data) to get the faces right side up.

Also, please use watermarks if you are posting your plots
