Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q4 in this thread.

For spectral clustering specifically you can use the sklearn kmeans package for the kmeans portion only, but you must implement the spectral clustering portion of the code yourselves. We allow this because the primary algorithm in this problem is spectral clustering, not kmeans. In general, when an algorithm is a smaller part of a larger algorithm, we allow package use for the smaller piece while you code the larger piece.

Comment from User 1230103:
During office hours (January 07, 47:30), Neepa mentioned that we also need to calculate the weighted mismatch rate for each k, but this wasn't mentioned in the homework. The homework states: "We will treat the network as an undirected graph."

Additionally, we don't have the information for weighted edges, correct? Could you please clarify whether we are required to calculate the weighted mismatch rate?

  Comment from User 979414:
  I am assuming she meant, the weighted mismatch rate based on the size of the clusters
