Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

To clarify the wording in part 1 of this question, if we’re showing an adjacency matrix, then we don’t need to illustrate a few images? That’s only for the scatter plots of the embeddings/principal components for part 2 and 3 where we also show images?

  Comment from User 134876:
  You should display a few images for both methods, whether scatter plot or adjacency matrix.

    Comment from User 1230133:
    When it says "illustrate a few images corresponds to nodes at different parts of the graph" - by "images" does it mean the images of faces? Given that the individual nodes represent distances, what does it mean for images to "correspond to nodes at different parts of the graph"?

    Hi Mark, I think Julia's question was still a cause for confusion for some of us. This is also my question as well, if we choose to plot the adjacency matrix. Could you please provide more clarity?
