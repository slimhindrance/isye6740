Hey class,

Setting up this space to allow our TAs to introduce themselves.

We have a very diverse set of TAs this semester, each with their own experiences and perspectives to contribute to the course...so I think it would be good to let you know a bit about us/our backgrounds/what we're interested in.

Hey everyone!

I am an OMSA alum and I work as a federal data science and AI consultant and product developer. This is my second semester TA'ing this course, and I've TA'ed 6501 in the past. 

Fun fact: In my spare time I'm training as a pilot
