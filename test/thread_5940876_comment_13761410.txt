    Hi Kevin, 

Terribly sorry for the late reply I am travelling at the moment. As the project can be done individually I decided to do that instead of having a group. I currently have new born hence my time is tied to the baby. I also want to work with some of the data from my current work. 

All the best in this semester and  hope you are having a good learning time. 

Regards - Juan
