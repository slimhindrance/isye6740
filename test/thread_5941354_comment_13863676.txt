Comment from User 780084:
Is it normal if i reduce the cluster size whenever encountering an empty cluster, my total number of cluster will keep reducing to a much smaller number ?
this is very apparent when using L1 norm where my total cluster tend to reduce to single digit.

  Comment from User 307595:
  Curious as well!  For one of my tests I start with 24 clusters and it slowly reduces to 12.  In another test if I keep all 24 sometimes a cluster will become un-empty later in the processing.  Some guidance on removing empty clusters during processing versus at the end as a clean-up action would be great!

      Thank you!!  My output looks much better now after following that advice.
