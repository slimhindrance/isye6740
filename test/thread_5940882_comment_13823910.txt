Comment from User 1512054:
Hey! Is there a way to delete the very short videos (seconds long) from the media gallery? It can be challenging to navigate. Thanks!

  Comment from User 799310:
  Good point. I just cleaned up the media gallery, removing the office hours that looked like they were accidentally started (i.e. just a few seconds long)
