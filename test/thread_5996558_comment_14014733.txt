Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 652074:
I would like to double check what pakcage we are allow to use for Q3. 



Are we allow to load scipy.spatial.distance?

  Comment from User 896256:
  I know we can use a PCA package as part of the ISOMAP algorithm we code up. Just can't use an ISOMAP package.

  Comment from User 213547:
  yes you may. use scipy.spatial.distance
