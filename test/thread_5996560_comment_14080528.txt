I was reading TA Brent's response about doing (eigenface)T*â€‹(testimage) first before multiplying with (eigenface) regarding Q4 part 2. This got me wondering about how to translate a math formula that involves multiple sequential matrix multiplications into Python.

For example, if I want to write ISOMAP's C = -1/2 * H (D)^2 H in Python, should I do C = -1/2 * H @ ((D)^2 @ H) instead of -1/2 * H @ (D)^2 @ H because the latter matrices get multiplied first?

  Comment from User 1489130:
  I was under the impression that matrix multiplication is associative, therefore the order in which multiplication occurs doesn't matter, i.e.:

$(AB)C = A(BC)$

 On the other hand, matrix multiplication is not commutative, therefore:

$AB \neq BA$

but Brent's comment seems to center around the associative property.  

Brent, could you please elaborate further on why we have to multiply from right to left when the associative property says multiplying from left to right should produce the same result?

    Comment from User 215365:
    You are correct that the associative property applies to matrices. In the context of the original question, I was focusing on that particular order of multiplication to help with understanding that the first vector multiplication ($(eigenface)_i(eigenface)^{T}_{i}$) does not become 1. However, I should have not implied that associativity does not work in this case. The focus was more that things operate from right to left. The first calculation is a projection or inner product (the transpose of a vector multiplied with a column vector), and the second would be the vector being multiplied with a scalar. The first multiplication would show sort of a similarity between the eigenface vector and the test image as a projection. This will give you one scalar that weights the same eigenvector again to compare it to the test image.  However, the associative property is true for matrices. I apologize for the confusion.

      Got it.  I was unaware that reading from right to left helps interpret what the matrix multiplication is doing, so that's great to know.  Thanks so much for the detailed clarification!

    Thank you Jonathan and Brent! I was confused for a moment on whether associative property would not work in this case. I took some time to compare results of matrix multiplications in different orders and confirmed the same as you guys have mentioned. Thanks again!
