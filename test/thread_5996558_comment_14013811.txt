Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Struggling with coming up with a procedure to tune epsilon without resorting to brute force comparisons of the resulting scatter plot with what is shown in the paper. Saw the following snippet in the paper:




Would $r_0$ be the minimum value from the Distance matrix, $D$? Trying to relate manifold, M, to the various constructs mentioned in the lecture slides.
