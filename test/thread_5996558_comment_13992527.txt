There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 962039:
For the images, trying to confirm I'm reading in the data correctly, what direction should the first face be facing? When I initially read it in it's facing up, though if I try reshaping using F order it's another direction. The latter direction makes sense I think, though my Isomap plot seems to be mirrored compared to the slide in the lecture. (e.g. a left facing face is on the right side of the graph, but if the plot was mirrored it'd be as the lecture) Does this matter particularly or is there something I may be missing in reading in the data?

  Either direction is fine, and the mirror will happen randomly. As long as the overall shape is correct, you will get full points. The orientation of the plot and faces does not matter.
