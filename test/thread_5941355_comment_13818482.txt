Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q4 in this thread.

For spectral clustering specifically you can use the sklearn kmeans package for the kmeans portion only, but you must implement the spectral clustering portion of the code yourselves. We allow this because the primary algorithm in this problem is spectral clustering, not kmeans. In general, when an algorithm is a smaller part of a larger algorithm, we allow package use for the smaller piece while you code the larger piece.

I found that the same vertex [24, 24] and the edge [24, 23]  appeared twice in edge.txt. If I construct coo_matrix similar to test_football Demo Code, do I need to clean or process the adjacent matrix to handle these duplicates?  Is this expected? Thanks

  No you do not need to clean
