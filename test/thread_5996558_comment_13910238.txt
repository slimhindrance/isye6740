Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 1127985:
For the first question on Problem3 on ISOMAP, it specifies that we can show the adjacency matrix as an image, but how can we formulate the adjacency matrix if we don't know the tuned epsilon parameter to achieve the most reasonable performance. My assumption is that we have to look at the low-dimensional embedding (Question 2) to determine the performance of epsilon.

So for Question 1 in Problem 3, based on the value of points (5points), are we visualizing the adjacency matrix with a large epsilon where matrix is fully populated?

  Comment from User 896413:
  No, the adjacency matrix is not meant to be fully connected. Part of your task is to tune your epsilon to produce a meaningful adjacency matrix. If you need a hint on the value range you should try, please see Neepa's office hours. I also highly recommend looking up the paper referenced for this problem for contextual and theoretical background.

    Comment from User 1127985:
    Ok so my assumption was wrong where the homework problems are setup where it needs to be solve as Question 1, Question 2, and Question 3 sequentially. 

It's an overall  solution to the problem and Question 1 is just 5 points of the 25 points where the meaningful adjacency matrix printed in the report is 5 points.

      Comment from User 896413:
      Usually yes, but you don't need to visualize the adjacency matrix to perform parts 2 and 3. However, you do need to tune epsilon to get the correct ISOMAP embedding.
