Comment from User 962021:
I have normalized the data (zero mean & unit variance) , although the range is 1 to 99  before PCA. I thought it shouldn't hurt to normalize and went ahead with it as in the PCA_demo.py. 

Any thoughts ? Should we use the data as is ?

  A range of approaches are possible; see this post for an earlier question and answer. 

What you've described sounds like a reasonable approach.
