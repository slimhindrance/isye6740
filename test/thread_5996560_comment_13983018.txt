Comment from User 1325815:
Remark: You will have to perform downsampling of the image by a factor of 4 to turn them into a lower
resolution image as a preprocessing (e.g., reduce a picture of size 16-by-16 to 4-by-4). In this question, you
can implement your own code or call packages.

Is there a preferred technique for the downsampling?

  Comment from User 497513:
  The easiest way is to save every forth row/column and discard the rest.
