Hey class,

Setting up this space to allow our TAs to introduce themselves.

We have a very diverse set of TAs this semester, each with their own experiences and perspectives to contribute to the course...so I think it would be good to let you know a bit about us/our backgrounds/what we're interested in.

Hello All,

Currently I'm an OMSA student, and my background is in Finance with several years working in Corporate Finance in various roles and working now in Healthcare Management in New York. I took this class during Spring 2024 and had a great experience learning the class content and attending office hours. This is truly one of the best classes in OMSA. I highly recommend folks give it an opportunity and take advantage of all the resources provided by the teaching staff. My office hours are open Q&A, and I try to help students break down complex concepts into simpler ones. 

Fun fact: in the past I ran a half-marathon in Central Park.
