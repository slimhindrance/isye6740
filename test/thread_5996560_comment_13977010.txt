Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q4 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

Comment from User 1316216:
Should residuals be reproducible?  Every time I run my code I get something different, despite setting seeds inside the gradescope class, the gradescope methods, and outside where I run the code.  The overall decisions are the same as to where things match/don't match.

My residuals are often on the order of 10^-20 or even smaller; could it be machine epsilon interfering?

  Technically, your reported result in the report should match the output from your code.

I can't be sure about the random result issue as you described. It shouldn't be difference since there is no randomness in this problem, thus the result should be deterministic too. Please double-check your implementation at this point.

The residual magnitude doesn't sound quite right to me. (Even though it could be quite different based on your scaling strategy.)
