Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q1 here.

For 1.6, if you are using an example, you may use a PCA package.

Comment from User 121859:
Trying to understand what needs to be delivered on 1.2. Does a simple text explaining how to get the second and third directions would suffice?

  Comment from User 300188:
  Sure. It's not a proof in this question, just make sure to explain the steps to get the second and third directions (though not explicitly required, hopefully you include some type of mathematical formulation/expression in your explanation since it's more concise and easier to get ideas across).
