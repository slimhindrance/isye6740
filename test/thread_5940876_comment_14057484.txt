Hi everyone! I had a change and one of my group mates has decided to work alone because of scheduling, so trying again! My name is Ashleigh and I am in EST. I live on campus in atlanta on  and am available anytime besides weekdays from 3:30-7:00 pm because I run on the track team here at tech! I have worked as a data science intern for a sports analytics company and will be moving into the CPG industry as a data science intern for Kroger. I have always been someone to pull my weight and then some in group projects so would love to find some people will the same mindset.

  Hey Ashleigh, I'm looking for a team as well. I'm on the west coast (PST) which I think would actually work well with your schedule. About me:

Time Zone: PST (San Diego)

Communication: Anything works, email: eitokazu3@gatech.edu

Availability: I work full time on weekdays so after 4PM PST is ideal, but I'm flexible.

Experience: I am currently a Data Scientist doing R&D on golf club performance/design at Callaway Golf. My background is Mechanical Engineering, which I did for some years (same company) before transitioning to Data Science.

OMSA Program: This is my 8th class in the program.

Project Interests: I gravitate toward sports, but open to explore any other interesting options.

Let me know if you'd like to join up!

Thanks!
