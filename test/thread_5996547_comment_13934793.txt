Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q1 here.

For 1.6, if you are using an example, you may use a PCA package.

Comment from User 1497720:
For 1.3 would the identity matrix count as a valid U for the decomposition or did you only want non-I solutions?

  Comment from User 134876:
  Prof X confirmed that the identify matrix can be used for one of your decompositions, and the other should be a non-identity matrix solution.
