Hi all! I'm looking for a teammate to work as a group of 2.

Time Zone: PST (Mountain View, CA). CST and EST should work fine as well.


Communication: Whatsapp preferred but open to anything (Email/Slack/Discord etc)


Background: B.E. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. This is my 6th course in OMSA and I have 4.5 years of experience working as a Data Engineer in Bay Area Startups, F500s and AI Consultancies. I have solid background working in Data visualization, Data Analytics & ML, Data Engineering , and Database Administration & Management. My main strengths and python and SQL but I work with C and JavaScript too. 


Project topic: Something fun, interesting, or good for resume. Open to suggestions as well :)


Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kriti-rajesh/


Note: I am taking a break this semester to fully focus on OMSA and have ample time to focus on the course.

Let me know what topics you're interested in as well! You'll get a teammate who is easy to work with and puts in a lot of effort. You can email me kbapnad3@gatech.edu or reply below. Apologize in advance if I have picked up someone's format (I came across it and liked the presentation but all details are authentic).
