Comment from User 896123:
For Q2.1, I want to clarify the wording of the question "Form the 1-dimensional histogram and KDE to estimate the distributions of amygdala and acc, respectively." Does this mean form a 1-D histogram of the amygdala variable and a 1-D KDE of the acc variable? Or should we form a 1-D histogram and a 1-D KDE for each variable?

  Comment from User 1128373:
  I interpreted it as the latter, so 4 graphs:

1-D histogram for amygdala

1-D histogram for acc

1-D KDE for amygdala

1-D KDE for acc
