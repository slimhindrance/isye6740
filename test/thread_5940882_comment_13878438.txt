Hello! When will we get the times for the Homework Solutions review OH?

  Comment from User 134876:
  Solutions reviews will be scheduled after all students have had an opportunity to submit, earliest possible is always a week after the due date barring any special circumstances considering students can use up to 7 extension days on each assignment.
