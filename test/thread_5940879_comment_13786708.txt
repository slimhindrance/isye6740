During this course, you will be responsible for delivering a research style final project report. This will involve a Project Proposal, The Final Project itself, and professional peer reviews on both.

All official guidelines are posted on canvas, feel free to use this space to ask administrative questions related to the project.



Some initial notes below:

1. All students, whether completing the project individually or as part of a team (up to 3 students) must join a project group on canvas. This can be done by going to the left-hand navigation bar and clicking people -> Term Project Groups then selecting an empty team to join. Be sure to join the same team as your group mates should you be doing the project together with other students. See #29 for more details.

2. For project submission, only the report itself is required. Code and data do not need to be submitted for the final project.

thanks for the info - if I decide to go on project solo, how will I get scores for the peer review?

  Comment from User 896413:
  It will be the same as everyone else. Every person will have 3 peer reviews, so a 1-person group will have 3 peer reviews. In a 3-person group, their project will have 9 reviews in total.
