Comment from User 1230103:
Do we need to export (save) the compressed images to the zip folder, or is printing them in the Jupyter notebook sufficient?

  Comment from User 284691:
  Please be sure that all of the material to be graded, including the compressed images, appears in the .pdf report, which can be generated from your notebook. 

You are not required to save the compressed images separately in the zip folder. We'll run the script in the zip folder, and the script should generate the images.
