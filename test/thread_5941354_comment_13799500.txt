Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q3 in this thread.

All demo code walkthroughs are on #10

Comment from User 568225:
Is there a convergence criteria that we have to use for the distance between the new and old cluster to consider the implementation to be converged? I don't see this being mentioned in the lecture. Would a small number (e.g. 0.1) be sufficient?

  Comment from User 979414:
  You can use a very small number for that.
