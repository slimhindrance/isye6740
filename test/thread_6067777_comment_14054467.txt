Hello,

I am working through question 3.1 at the moment and having some difficulty with a few points.

Finding my epsilon value: I plotted a histogram of the distance between each point, but it appears to be about a normal distribution. In this case, should I choose value that creates multiple neighborhoods of points or use mean(dist)- X std(dist)? How can I better tune epsilon here?

When the question says "illustrate a few images corresponds to nodes at different parts of the graph": Are we just showing different graph neighborhoods? Does this want something from the underlying image's original luminosity?

I was able to establish multiple neighborhoods with epsilon=7.5 that includes labeled indices of each point, but I wasn't confident that's what was desired given the wording of the question.



Are you able to help clear this up for me or provide additional resources that can get me on the right path here?

Apologies - I found this discussion which touches on using a heat map for my second question, but I'm still confused on the images to show here.
