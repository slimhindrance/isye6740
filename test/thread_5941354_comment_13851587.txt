Comment from User 897194:
For "sea-turtle-400x225.png" can we convert the image from .png to .bmp which will drop the forth channel or do you want us to handle this is in the code?

  Comment from User 284691:
  I'd recommend dropping the fourth channel in the code, as conversion could potentially introduce other issues. You can safely ignore the fourth channel.
