Hi everyone, Nandhini here. This will be my 4th semester and 6th course. nkalyana3@gatech.edu is my email ID

Time Zone: IST, based in India. I prefer teammates from CET, IST, and Asia time zones for smoother collaboration. 

Communication: Text or emails preferred, with weekly calls for coordination. 

Experience: I am currently working as a Technology Analyst in a major private bank, with significant experience in technology and analytics. 

Skills: I have a strong math background, excellent practical experience with Python in my daily work, and expertise in building and implementing machine learning models. I am proficient in data visualization especially Tableau but inexperienced with MATLAB. I have worked with R. I have used basic Latex for final project in DVA course. I highly value well-documented projects and prefer teammates skilled in documentation to ensure the project is organized, polished, and easy to follow. 

Effort: In this semester, I am taking only one course, I am fully committed to this project and can dedicate my undivided attention to it. I prioritize planning ahead and completing deliverables early to achieve outstanding results and avoid last-minute challenges. 

Project Ideas: I am open to suggestions and flexible with topics. I am eager to work with the team to identify an idea that aligns with everyoneâ€™s interests and strengths, ensuring a rewarding and successful collaboration.
