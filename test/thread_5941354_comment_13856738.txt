Comment from User 1230133:
Apologies if someone has already asked this, but when I submit to Gradescope, I get this error (No module named 'scipy') -- here's how I load it in my script: from scipy.sparse import csc_matrix. I know this is supposed to be added to requirements.txt so that it's allowed to be used but does this mean it hasn't been added yet?

  We will add scipy support to gradescope in 2 hours.

    Comment from User 979414:
    This is resolved now
