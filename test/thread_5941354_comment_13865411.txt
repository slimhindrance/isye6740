All demo code walkthroughs are on #10

Comment from User 896416:
I can't get my algorithm to complete in under 10 minutes. I'm computing distances using numpy on matrices, so I don't see why it's taking so long. any tips or suggestions on how to calculate distances and assign labels efficiently?

  You can take a look at the week 2 demo code and other notebooks the TAs wrote on vectorization examples here. 

Besides these resources, you can isolate parts of the algorithm into helper functions or code blocks and time each section to identify where your code is running slow.
