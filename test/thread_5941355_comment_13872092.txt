Please ask all questions related to HW1 Q4 in this thread.

For spectral clustering specifically you can use the sklearn kmeans package for the kmeans portion only, but you must implement the spectral clustering portion of the code yourselves. We allow this because the primary algorithm in this problem is spectral clustering, not kmeans. In general, when an algorithm is a smaller part of a larger algorithm, we allow package use for the smaller piece while you code the larger piece.

Hi TAs, 

I am using spectral clustering variant for my analysis: 

$$B\ =D^{-\frac{1}{2}}A\ D^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$

When I calculate the eigenvalues, I get negative values as well as B can be non-positive definite.
Am I suppose to take the max k based on the absolute values of eigenvalues or should I consider sign as well. Thanks.

  It should be the maximum with the signs accounted for.
