Please ask all questions related to HW2 Q3 here.

There are no runtime requirements for this question, however please keep it reasonable (<10min).

See #130 for additional notes.

PCA package can be used as part of the ISOMAP algorithm. ISOMAP, MDS, and cmdscale (MATLAB) packages are not permitted for this question.

Comment from User 1498558:
Hi instructors, is this supposed to be inf instead of 0 otherwise? I have difficulty understanding why we should reduce the distance to 0 if it exceeds the epsilon threshold.

  Comment from User 799310:
  I believe the image is correct. Setting it to 0 indicates no edge when the distance exceeds epsilon. Using infinity could suggest an existing edge with a very large weight, which is not what we want.

    Comment from User 1512070:
    Most shortest path algorithms I've worked with would consider this an arc with zero weight, so you'd have to put a special case for this application.  Furthermore, if a zero weight means no arc then that makes the behavior of the algorithm discontinuous when you get close to zero.  In the ISOMAP paper referenced in this module, Table 1 step 2 defines an infinite distance as having no arc.   Is there some practical reason for wanting it to be zero?
