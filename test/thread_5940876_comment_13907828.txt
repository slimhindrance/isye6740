  Hi Xingying, 

Are you still looking to join a team? 

Phillip McElroy and I are looking for a third person to join our project team since our original partner had to drop the class for this semester. 

We are interested in doing something related to the energy industry. Please see a little summary about us below and let us know if you're interested ASAP. Our emails are justin.rodriguez110@gatech.edu and pmcelroy3@gatech.edu. Thank you!

About me: 

I live in Phoenix, AZ, and I currently work as a senior data scientist / energy demand forecaster for a major utility company. I'm looking to work on something related to the energy sector (more details below). Please reach out if you're interested in learning more about me and interested in possibly working together! 

Time Zone: Mountain Standard Time (Phoenix, AZ)

Communication: Ed, Slack, Teams, FaceTime, Email, Phone,

Experience: Currently work as a data scientist forecasting energy demand for a major utility company. Previous experience in data analytics in emergency management. Undergraduate degree in Econ and Math. Graduated Highest Honors.

Classes taken: ISYE 6501, CSE 6040, ISYE 6644 (Simulation), ISYE 6420 (Bayes), ISYE 6203 - As in all

Skills: Proficient in Python (NumPy, Pandas, several other packages), SQL, Tableau / Power BI, and Microsoft Office Suite (including advanced Excel). Also strong with R but may take me a minute to get back into the swing of things with that language. Strong quantitative / mathematical background in general. 

Project Topic: I am interested in just about anything related to the energy sector - forecasting energy demand, optimizing generation resources, analyzing renewable energy resources (e.g., solar and wind), etc. I'm also interested in the intersection of public utilities and emergency management such as using machine learning algorithms to better plan for and mitigate disasters such as the wildfires we are sadly seeing in Southern California right now. (I think some image detection algorithms could be applied here? Not too familiar with the tech at the moment, but it interests me.)



About Phillip:
